    "body": "The storm was less about wind speed than water volume: an estimated 13bn m\u00b3 of rain in 24 hours flooded 1.1m hectares, damaged 720,000 buildings and severed key roads and rail. The government invoked the Public Security Ordinance, convened the National Council for Disaster Management, and began compensation and resettlement planning while tasking agencies with a unified data platform and landslide certification. Yet early warnings were uneven, legal frameworks (the Disaster Management Act) proved dated, and building codes and zoning have lagged risk realities. The next phase must hard\u2011wire risk into development: relocate from geologically unsafe zones, enforce flood\u2011resilient design, modernise reservoir operations, and embed fit\u2011for\u2011purpose early\u2011warning triggers that translate into automatic, pre\u2011agreed actions. The prize is twofold: fewer lives disrupted in the next deluge\u2014and lower fiscal costs over time. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f"

A Foreign Aid Coordination Committee is being set up to keep flows transparent and targeted. The pattern is familiar: Sri Lanka\u2019s ability to tap Indian, Western and multilateral help simultaneously reflects a foreign policy that works best when it is steady, predictable, and non\u2011exclusive. \ud83e\udd1d"

    "body": "A lively debate has re\u2011opened over fiscal space. One camp argues that a currency\u2011issuing state can prioritise rupee outlays for relief and reconstruction, with inflation risks managed by supply restoration and import prioritisation. Another stresses hard external constraints and insists on staying the course with the IMF. In practice, the state is doing both: ADB approved $200m to boost water and food security; the Treasury says tax\u2011to\u2011GDP has rebounded to about 15.4% and is tracking 16%\u2014key to credibility; and Parliament is being asked to focus on medium\u2011term reforms even as near\u2011term cash reaches households. The art now is sequencing\u2014front\u2011load essential repairs, protect external balances, and lay out a transparent rebuild pipeline that private lenders and donors can co\u2011finance. \ud83d\udcb8"

For Sri Lanka, the playbook is familiar: deepen trust with India (Colombo Security Conclave, fisheries management, transparent port access), keep Chinese, Japanese, ASEAN and Gulf ties economic, and draft an overdue National Security Strategy to guide choices.
