    "body": "With hundreds dead, hundreds more missing and over a million people affected across all 25 districts, Sri Lanka declared a state of emergency as floods and landslides exposed systemic weaknesses. Early warnings were issued, yet evacuation and last\u2011mile communications lagged; illegal hillside construction and blocked drainage amplified losses. The National Building Research Organisation (NBRO) needs binding powers, the long-delayed National Building Code must be accelerated, and environmental impact assessments enforced. Otherwise the next storm will be a consequence, not an accident \ud83c\udf27\ufe0f."

    "body": "Colombo set up a \u2018Rebuilding Sri Lanka\u2019 Fund and a Management Committee to channel relief and reconstruction. MPs insist Parliament must authorise it and oversee spending\u2014consistent with the Constitution and the Public Financial Management Act. The all\u2011male, business\u2011heavy committee has drawn criticism for lacking disaster, health, gender and community representation. Anchoring governance to the Sendai Framework\u2019s \u2018whole\u2011of\u2011society\u2019 principle and giving legal teeth to oversight would build trust and curb the risks of past fund misuse. Acronyms watch: Sendai is the UN\u2019s global disaster\u2011risk blueprint; transparency is the domestic one."

The effort dovetails with the Colombo Security Conclave\u2019s growing regional toolbox. Others followed: the US committed $2m and airlift support; Japan sent an assessment team, emergency goods and a 30\u2011strong medical unit (via WHO-SEARHEF funds); Australia pledged AUD 1m; Nepal, Maldives, Bangladesh, Pakistan, the UAE and China sent cash and supplies.

SLT\u2011Mobitel launched a 247 medical helpline with the University of Colombo; Starlink credited free satellite service through December for affected users. The World Health Organization released $175,000 and backed rapid response teams. The lesson: climate\u2011proof the health system by integrating meteorological feeds with disease surveillance, and build redundant communications that function under stress. SEARHEF\u2014WHO\u2019s regional emergency fund\u2014helped, but domestic \u2018digital fortification\u2019 must now follow \ud83d\udce1."

    "body": "The disaster struck at peak season, denting arrivals despite reassurances that most sites reopened quickly. Upcountry vegetables, tea estates, roads, bridges and power lines suffered heavy damage, pushing up imports of staples and equipment, widening the trade gap. Market estimates range from $200m to $2.9bn, with the final tally likely at 1\u20133% of GDP. A national infrastructure bond, debt\u2011for\u2011resilience swaps, and targeted support for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) can soften the blow. Acronyms decoded: MSMEs are the backbone of jobs; IMF conditionality must not crowd out climate adaptation."

Construction, telecoms and banks led turnover; insurers and logistics should brace for claims and capex. Against the gloom, DFCC listed Sri Lanka\u2019s first blue bond to finance ocean\u2011positive projects, and banks teed up subordinated debentures to fortify capital. Investors are weighing near\u2011term earnings hits against policy credibility and the speed of reopening. Volatility will persist until damage data firm up \ud83d\udcc8."

Platforms such as PickMe\u2019s AID feature moved donations; telecoms extended zero\u2011rated services.

The opposition also demanded that the Rebuilding Fund be brought under parliamentary control. Separately, a smouldering Customs containers scandal resurfaced. The political risk is clear: if oversight and delivery falter, the narrative shifts from \u2018natural disaster\u2019 to \u2018avoidable loss\u2019.
