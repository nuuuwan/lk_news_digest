    "body": "Sri Lanka\u2019s second NPP Budget cements continuity with the IMF: a push for a primary surplus, a **deficit of ~5% of GDP** and debt on a glide path to **95% of GDP in 2026**. Markets cheered\u2014equities hit new highs and Fitch lauded the fiscal anchors\u2014but the growth engine remains under\u2011specified. Critics from across the aisle flagged a revenue \u201cmirage,\u201d as import\u2011tax windfalls (notably cars) and base\u2011widening (lowering the VAT threshold to **Rs. 36 m**) risk masking weak tax administration and crowding out productive credit. The Ceylon Chamber welcomed stability yet urged converting fiscal gains into **capex with impact**\u2014ports, logistics, digital, energy, irrigation. The bigger miss: a time\u2011bound plan to phase out para\u2011tariffs that keep export costs high. Without sharper execution on reforms, the Budget\u2019s target of **~7% growth** looks more aspirational than programmatic. \ud83d\udcc8\u2696\ufe0f"

The Government aims to enact the PPP Act by Q1 2026, roll out a Screening & Scoring tool for projects, and pass an **Investment Protection Act**\u2014tackling years of institutional overlap. At Colombo Port City, the Commission insists the original incentives remain intact and competitive, and rightly pivots from more tax breaks to easier entry: residency/visa rules, expatriate hiring, IP timelines, and clarity on global income filings. The agenda is credible; the challenge is throughput. The SEC\u2019s refresher on directors\u2019 liabilities\u2014reminding boards of **37 civil and 131 criminal exposures**\u2014is a timely nudge that governance, not glossy brochures, will determine whether Sri Lanka captures the next wave of FDI. \ud83e\udded\ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f"

But budgets are lean and coordination is hard: real payoff hinges on interoperable registries, e\u2011payments at zero fees for micro\u2011transactions, and agencies adopting shared rails rather than bespoke silos.

The episode exposes a familiar governance gap: parents are primary educators, but they need evidence\u2011based tools. With studies citing **~60% of schoolchildren showing symptoms of depression** and **24% of seniors significant symptoms**, a curriculum that pairs biology with consent, safety, and dignity\u2014validated by clinicians and educators\u2014would be a public\u2011health intervention, not social engineering. \ud83e\udde0\ud83e\uddd2\ud83c\udffd"

Then, a wounded but dominant figure faced a weak government; today, the NPP holds the initiative, markets are calmer, and the Opposition is fragmented.
