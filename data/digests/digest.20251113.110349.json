    "body": "The second NPP Budget keeps faith with hard targets\u2014aiming for a primary surplus of about 2.5% of GDP and total revenue near **15.3\u201315.4% of GDP**\u2014and doubles down on digitalisation, PPPs and investment facilitation. Markets cheered: the ASPI pushed beyond **23,500**, with turnover repeatedly topping **Rs. 7\u20138 bn**. Yet a projected **7%** growth path jars with the IMF\u2019s **~3%** outlook and a still-shallow investment pipeline. The state\u2019s capital spend remains modest relative to ambition, and fiscal space will tighten as external debt service ramps up in 2028. The Budget\u2019s pivot to rules-based incentives, a residency visa for investors and amendments to the Strategic Development Projects and Port City Acts is sound; success now hinges on timely execution (single trade window, e-GP, SOE/PPP laws) and not just policy signalling. \ud83d\udcc8"

But part of the revenue overperformance rests on reopened imports (notably vehicles), risking **FX leakage**, rupee pressure (spot **~Rs. 304\u2013305**/$), and higher fuel demand. With **credit growth** skewed to cards, pawning and leases rather than capex, the risk is a consumption-led sugar high. The policy challenge is to convert the stabilisation dividend into exportable capacity\u2014through trade facilitation, para-tariff phase-out, and investment into logistics, services and agri-tech\u2014before global headwinds (e.g., tariff risks on key apparel markets) bite. \ud83d\udea6"

The National Agency for PPP targets an **early-2026** PPP Act and an Investment Protection Act, while screening tools and procurement rules are being updated. The Ceylon Chamber backed **18** of its proposals in the Budget, but warned the real test is implementation discipline and SOE reform. The Port City Commission\u2019s emphasis on streamlined visas, IP timelines and clarity on global income reporting is pragmatic. Without speed on approvals, investors will default to Dubai/GIFT City playbooks. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f"

Directors were urged to read their Articles, police conflicts, and respect solvency tests (s.57) as a \u2018golden thread\u2019. The Registrar reminded issuers of **30-day** ultimate beneficial ownership filings for listed firms, and the CSE warned that late, unclear board papers erode oversight. With new delisting rules imposing **3-year** fit-and-proper bans on directors of mandatorily delisted firms, governance is no longer a soft metric. The message: compliance systems matter less than their implementation\u2014and minutes matter. \ud83e\udded"

The CSE\u2019s liquidity is now buoyed by crossings in banks, diversifieds and industrials.

Yet logistics reliability remains a constraint\u2014shipping lines have bypassed Colombo over yard and inter-terminal transfer frictions\u2014imperilling apparel just-in-time chains. The Budget\u2019s single window, tariff policy reset and BIA expansion revival are timely; phasing out para-tariffs (e.g., PAL, CESS, SCL) would lower input costs and boost competitiveness. With the apparel sector exposed to tariff volatility, services niches (ICT, arbitration, asset management) via Port City and the diaspora are promising buffers if regulatory plumbing works. \ud83c\udf0f"
