    "title": "A revived statue controversy and a rainy rally put identity politics back at centre stage",
    "body": "An opposition show-of-force in Nugegoda and an overnight Buddha statue installation in Trincomalee rekindled the combustible mix of religion and politics. The rally boosted Namal Rajapaksa\u2019s profile as a parallel opposition leader, while the statue episode \u2014 echoing 2005 \u2014 risks turning local land-use disputes into national flashpoints. The government\u2019s calmer response avoided immediate escalation, but the politics are clear: a bid to re-frame the opposition space around Sinhala-Buddhist grievance, complicating the National People\u2019s Power (NPP) government\u2019s effort to keep the conversation on cost of living and reform. The timing is notable: the same week saw outreach to Tamil and Muslim leaders for a more inclusive \u2018Sri Lanka Day\u2019, underscoring the country\u2019s split-screen politics."

    "body": "The 2026 Budget hews to fiscal consolidation, but the devil is in execution. Parliament\u2019s Committee on Public Finance (CoPF) hearings exposed confusion over reserve metrics and a widening gap between appropriations and capital spending. A new Public Finance Management Act caps primary spending at 13% of GDP, limiting room for education to move beyond ~2% of GDP. Meanwhile, Port City law amendments to \u201cencourage\u201d investment via tax tweaks and stronger oversight were cleared for gazetting; they will be judged by whether they attract credible capital rather than regulatory arbitrage. The government\u2019s reform credibility was also tested by frictions with the Right to Information Commission over budgets and independence, and by the criminalisation trend under the Online Safety Act \u2014 risks to trust that no primary surplus can paper over."

    "body": "A pilot for card-based bus fare payments launched at Makumbura, with a July 2026 start for a Colombo \u2018metro bus\u2019 service run via a distinct entity under SLTB. If executed, the template could thin leakages, simplify VAT and policing of fares, and professionalise the sector. The administration promises separate HR and pay structures \u2014 critical to avoid capture by legacy practices. The test will be scale, uptime and whether digital rails (e\u2011ticketing, open APIs) feed a broader digital public infrastructure, not just a shiny front-end. Done right, this is governance reform disguised as ticketing \ud83c\udfab."

    "title": "Capital markets and coffers swell, but retail investors still pay the steepest toll",
    "body": "Customs hit record monthly and single\u2011day collections; tax receipts are on track, and banks and finance companies reported buoyant earnings as credit revives. Yet the Colombo Stock Exchange\u2019s fee architecture \u2014 cited at roughly 2.27% round\u2011trip for small trades \u2014 is a structural deterrent to retail participation, while negotiated discounts for large blocks tilt the field. Amendments to Port City\u2019s regime could catalyse listings and structured finance, but investor protection and fee rationalisation will determine whether Sri Lanka builds breadth, not just bursts of turnover. Without that, liquidity remains captive to cycles and crossings, and households keep wealth under the proverbial mattress."

    "body": "Teacher and principal unions threaten a December strike over pay, workload, and top\u2011down education reforms \u2014 a headache for a government that also pledges fiscal restraint. Online, \u201cpig\u2011butchering\u201d scams \u2014 social\u2011engineering cons fattening victims before fleecing them \u2014 spread using deepfakes of national figures. The solution set spans public education, bank alerting, and collaboration with blockchain analytics firms. On digital harms, a UNFPA/UN Women study reported high rates of technology\u2011facilitated gender\u2011based violence; tightening the Online Safety Act into a civil\u2011remedy\u2011first framework, rather than broad criminalisation of speech, would help. Safety needs law, but trust needs proportion."

    "body": "A rare environmental win saw Minneriya\u2019s \u2018Great Gathering\u2019 of elephants safeguarded after agencies agreed in court to revert to historic reservoir drawdown patterns. Elsewhere, biodiversity advocates and firms marked a decade of restoration partnerships, even as a senior jurist warned that AI\u2019s water and energy appetite will stress fragile grids. In the power sector, the rollback of 2024 unbundling has critics warning of stunted competition; pragmatic fixes \u2014 ring\u2011fenced accounts, transparent dispatch, and reverse auctions for renewables \u2014 could still deliver least\u2011cost capacity. And a push to revisit the oil palm ban, citing updated agronomy and import substitution, pits science\u2011led plantation policy against old shibboleths. The choice: principled pragmatism, or performative purity \ud83c\udf31."

    "title": "A farm policy reset beckons: pay for production, not inputs",
    "body": "With rice prices sensitive and import curbs under review, a more durable fix is to shift from fertiliser subsidies to output\u2011based aid: scan\u2011and\u2011pay incentives at point of sale, using QR IDs and IoT\u2011linked scales. That would reward yield, trim leakages, and generate real\u2011time stock data for trade policy. SMEs got concessional credit and lower investment thresholds in Budget 2026; pairing that with an export single window and diaspora tie\u2011ups (a new BELGOLUX\u2013Sri Lanka council launched in Brussels, while a Canada roadshow courted FDI) can turn agriculture and light industry from fiscal cost centres into forex earners. It\u2019s boring plumbing \u2014 and exactly what the macro needs."

The United States reaffirmed cooperation \u2014 the US Ambassador met the President and the PM, with nods to education ties (Fulbright, Peace Corps). Europe\u2011facing business diplomacy gathered pace with the BELGOLUX council launch and private missions to Canada. Meanwhile, domestic governance wrestled with hard trade\u2011offs \u2014 from Port City tax amendments to defence of free expression under the Parliamentary Privileges Act \u2014 reminding investors that policy is made where geopolitics, law and politics meet. Acronyms to watch: IMF (International Monetary Fund), RTI (Right to Information), and PPP (public\u2011private partnership) \u2014 each a test of credibility."
