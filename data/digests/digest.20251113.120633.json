    "body": "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake\u2019s second Budget locks in IMF-style consolidation while signalling a pivot to investment-led growth. It trims recurrent excess, proposes PPP and investment-protection laws, opens state land for vetted FDI, and dangles residence visas for investors. Markets cheered: the CSE hit fresh highs and Fitch praised the fiscal path. Business, from the Ceylon Chamber to apparel brands, welcomed policy stability but asked for faster, clearer implementation, especially on trade facilitation, SOE/PPP laws and investor incentives. The sting is the VAT net widening (threshold down to Rs. 36m) and a still-modest capital push. A plantation wage hike to Rs. 1,750 is popular but needs productivity and value-add to avoid margin squeeze. As ever, the test is delivery, not design. \ud83d\udcc8"

Beneficial-ownership rules and solvency tests are moving from compliance to culture. That sits uneasily with political theatre: former Tourism Minister Prasanna Ranatunga was arrested by the Bribery Commission and bailed\u2014an emblem of due process, not yet of deterrence. If anti-corruption is to be more than headlines, procurement, independence and enforcement must mature together. \u2696\ufe0f"

    "body": "The long-frozen Provincial Council (PC) polls resurfaced after former Election Commissioner Mahinda Deshapriya flagged a Supreme Court dictum that Governors cannot run provinces indefinitely. The Socialist Alliance demanded dates or a legal workaround to run under PR until delimitation ends. Meanwhile ITAK warned the President that appointing more ex-security officials to the Office of Reparations would gut credibility\u2014three of five members would be from security services if two nominees go through. For a government courting investors and EU trade preferences, strengthening rule of law and reconciliation is not just ethics\u2014it is economics. \ud83e\udded"

The Prime Minister, who also holds Education, defended age-appropriate lessons backed by the Health Ministry, Family Health Bureau and the National Child Protection Authority, citing rising abuse cases and safety needs. In parallel, academics questioned rushed psychometric testing in schools and warned of the pitfalls of high-stakes literacy/numeracy regimes. With studies pointing to widespread childhood depression, reforms need transparent curricula, trained teachers and parental trust\u2014less polemic, more evidence. \ud83e\udde0"

The PPP Act and an Investment Protection Act are slated for early 2026. Success will hinge on clean data governance, cybersecurity, and clear user consent. \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83d\udcbb"

    "body": "Sri Lanka pitched at the Shanghai CIIE with tea, gems and coconut wares; welcomed Asia-Pacific business leaders to Colombo for CACCI; and set up a Sri Lanka\u2013Saudi business council alongside ministerial talks. At home, Port City incentives are being fine-tuned and residence visas for investors offered. The PPP framework is due in Q1. Yet exporters and SMEs still face tight credit, skills gaps and trade-policy drift. Concluding deeper, rules-based FTAs and fixing customs-to-port frictions would turn receptions into receipts."
