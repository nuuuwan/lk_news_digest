    "title": "Budget 2026 marries IMF discipline to cautious relief, but tax design and wage politics test credibility",
    "body": "The 2026 Budget keeps Sri Lanka on the rails of its IMF (International Monetary Fund) programme: a primary surplus, tighter public investment choices and a pivot to digital tax administration. The move to lower the VAT (Value-Added Tax) registration threshold to Rs. 36 million broadens the net, while the continued 2.5% SSCL (Social Security Contribution Levy) alongside VAT risks double\u2011taxing the same base and squeezing SMEs\u2019 cashflow. A headline pledge to lift plantation workers\u2019 take\u2011home pay via a Rs. 200/day state-funded attendance incentive has run into a legal challenge\u2014critics argue the Treasury cannot subsidise private-sector wages. Debt arithmetic remains tight, even as authorities say future ISB (International Sovereign Bond) service is \u201cmanageable\u201d. The test now is execution: clean tax design, lawful wage support, and project selection that protects scarce fiscal space."

    "body": "Big listed groups reported stronger earnings\u2014Dialog Axiata\u2019s EBITDA rose 40% YTD, Hayleys kept profit growth, Aitken Spence lifted PBT 42%, and banks such as BOC and Sampath posted double\u2011digit PAT gains\u2014signalling cost control and easing macro stress. Yet textile exporter Teejay flagged weak global demand, and CSE liquidity stayed soft despite JF Packaging\u2019s strong IPO debut. Sentiment improved after SriLankan Airlines struck a deal to restructure its defaulted bonds, but turnover remains brittle. This is a \u201cnormalisation without exuberance\u201d: profitability is up, volumes and investment still lag."

    "title": "SOE reform and PPPs will be judged by the first deals\u2014not by policy speeches",
    "body": "The new PPP (public\u2011private partnership) law and CEB unbundling are necessary, but investors will price Sri Lanka on project quality, risk sharing and delivery. Deloitte\u2019s Asia team warned that exchange\u2011rate risk and under\u2011prepared pipelines deter capital; ticket sizes under $50\u2013100m will struggle to attract long\u2011term funds. India\u2019s experience\u2014MOUs with performance targets, listed SOEs paying steady dividends\u2014shows reform credibility compels capital. Sri Lanka\u2019s early PPPs must come with bankable feasibility, fair risk allocation and transparent procurement, or private finance will wait on the sidelines."

    "body": "Sri Lanka launched the Sri Lanka\u2013Saudi Arabia Business Council; hosted a Luxembourg investment seminar; and co\u2011convened a Korea\u2013Sri Lanka investment forum to fix bottlenecks. Oman invited Sri Lankan capital into logistics, tourism and manufacturing under Vision 2040, while Belavia\u2019s Minsk\u2013Mattala route broadens air links. Vietnam\u2019s embassy probed opportunities in the Northern Province. These are small but cumulative steps to diversify partners and services\u2014tourism, education, ICT and light manufacturing\u2014beyond slow\u2011moving merchandise exports."

    "title": "Digital rails are being laid\u2014from Google Pay to shrimp-farm data\u2014but equity and upkeep will decide outcomes",
    "body": "Commercial Bank became the first to enable Google Pay with Visa tokenisation; FAO and the Fisheries Ministry launched SIIS, a farm\u2011to\u2011regulator shrimp aquaculture platform using IoT/AI; and Dialog showcased 5G use\u2011cases at INFOTEL. These are the right pipes for a modern economy. But as experts reminded, devices, teacher training, maintenance and rural connectivity determine whether platforms lift productivity or become stranded assets. The same governance lesson applies elsewhere: instead of curbing the RTI (Right to Information) Act, strengthening the Information Commission\u2019s staffing and budgets would protect transparency gains."

    "title": "Tourism\u2019s next chapter must prioritise higher-yield niches, not raw volume",
    "body": "With arrivals rebounding, industry voices argued for \u2018niche excellence\u2019 over mass marketing: hiking (Pekoe Trail), wellness, design and architecture, birding, agro\u2011experiences, and slow rail can disperse visitors, deepen local spend and protect carrying capacity. New air links help, but success hinges on basics\u2014waste and water systems, signage, trail stewardship, trained guides\u2014and careful storytelling that filters for intent, not just clicks. In short: shift from beach\u2011and\u2011selfie to purpose\u2011driven trips with higher retention and lower ecological stress."

    "title": "Agri\u2011industry contradictions: palm oil, poultry feed and estate wages expose policy trade\u2011offs",
    "body": "A data\u2011rich case to replace Sri Lanka\u2019s crude palm oil cultivation ban with regulated licensing notes higher yields and lower land/water footprints versus substitutes; meanwhile, a Rs. 25/kg SCL on imported maize keeps feed costs high, hobbling a technologically advanced poultry sector. Both policies depress competitiveness and raise consumer prices. On plantations, wage justice is overdue, but a fiscal workaround via Treasury incentives risks setting precedent without fixing productivity, land use and value\u2011addition. Coherent agri policy would pair fair wages with yield\u2011raising investment, smarter trade taxes and environmental safeguards."

    "body": "The Environment Ministry pitched carbon credits as a $250\u2013300m annual opportunity within a decade, with mangroves, forests and renewables as anchors. Concurrently, academics urged a science\u2011led \u2018blue economy\u2019: PPP\u2011ready ports and logistics, aquaculture with biosecurity, and a marine research station at Kachchativu to depoliticise fisheries and rebuild stocks. Both agendas demand rigorous baselines, transparent registries, clear user rights and inter\u2011agency coordination\u2014or they risk becoming slide\u2011deck aspirations rather than exportable assets."

    "title": "Procurement optics matter: the double\u2011cab tender and RTI anxiety risk eroding public trust",
    "body": "A plan to procure 1,775 double\u2011cab pickups has drawn scrutiny over compressed bidding windows and eligibility filters that could limit competition, while civil society warns against amending the RTI law instead of resourcing the Information Commission. For a government elected on integrity and thrift, procurement transparency and openness to scrutiny are as important as macro metrics. Rebuild credibility by publishing tender justifications, timelines and contracts, and by empowering oversight bodies."
