    "title": "Cyclone Ditwah turned a fiscal crisis into a governance stress test",
    "body": "With lives lost, over a million displaced and infrastructure battered, Ditwah exposed a yawning gap between accurate national warnings and local execution: red alerts did not translate into targeted, time\u2011bound evacuations in landslide belts, and last\u2011mile risk communication failed. The administration has pivoted from response to recovery, but critics and courts alike have flagged non\u2011activation of the Disaster Management Plan and weak inter\u2011agency coordination. The policy lesson is not partisan: Sri Lanka needs an automatic, colour\u2011coded trigger regime for evacuations, hard redundancy in power\u2013water networks, and district authority to act without Colombo\u2019s clearance. The alternative is serial \u201cmanaged chaos\u201d every monsoon."

    "title": "International solidarity arrived fast; domestic credibility will decide whether it endures",
    "body": "The week saw a cascade of aid: India\u2019s bridges, engineers and airlift (\u201cOperation Sagar Bandhu\u201d), US INDOPACOM C\u2011130s and logistics, Japan\u2019s tents and water kits, Australia\u2019s cash for WFP and UNFPA programmes, EU/ECHO and CERF allocations, Germany, Switzerland and Russia\u2019s shipments, Myanmar\u2019s medical cargo, and regional philanthropy (Maldives, Tamil Nadu, Thai and Swiss communities). This early surge buys time, not certainty. The Rebuilding Sri Lanka Fund\u2019s governance\u2014ring\u2011fenced accounts, public dashboards, independent audit, and clear project pipelines\u2014will determine if grants convert into resilient assets rather than a post\u2011tsunami replay. Trust, not just tonnage, is the scarcest input."

    "title": "The private sector proved it is a response asset\u2014not a bystander",
    "body": "Telcos restored thousands of sites and fibre backbones, opened free connectivity and field Wi\u2011Fi; the Banks Association pledged disaster debt relief; exporters, chambers and brands mobilised cash, supplies and data analytics; insurers and tech firms kept claims and cybersecurity training running. These moves underscore a structural point: private balance sheets and logistics can be embedded\u2014ex\u2011ante\u2014into national contingency plans through pre\u2011signed MOUs, shared data pipes, and drills. That turns improvisation into orchestration the next time the rain stalls overhead."

    "title": "Budget 2026 now needs a cyclone addendum and a results office",
    "body": "Parliament passed the Budget framed pre\u2011Ditwah; the macro now shifts. A one\u2011off reconstruction envelope of 3\u20135% of GDP must be prioritised without unravelling IMF anchors. A National Budget Performance and Evaluation Office\u2014as proposed by academics\u2014would track outputs (bridges reopened, schools restored, landslide buffers built) and outcomes (travel times, school attendance, disaster losses) with monthly dashboards. In a cash\u2011tight recovery, evidence, not applause lines, should decide which rupee moves first."

    "title": "From welfare to resilience: target climate finance, not blank cheques",
    "body": "UNDP and others argue the Colombo\u2013Gampaha corridor\u2019s submerged assets make Sri Lanka a textbook case for adaptation finance. That requires shovel\u2011ready, bankable pipelines: river training and floodplain restoration, \u2018sponge city\u2019 drainage, hill\u2011slope stabilisation, climate\u2011smart agriculture, and hospital\u2013school hardening. Green taxation\u2014pricing pollution, rationalising plastic and congestion, with revenues earmarked for visible resilience\u2014can both nudge behaviour and co\u2011finance projects. Done transparently, it attracts concessional dollars; done opaquely, it deters them."

    "title": "Disaster law must protect children as aggressively as assets",
    "body": "With 275,000+ children affected and shelters stretched, the NCPA warned against predatory \u201ccare offers\u201d and activated the 1929 helpline, while UNFPA flagged rising GBV risks in crowded centres. The response needs child\u2011centred protocols\u2014ID and reunification systems, safe spaces, school\u2011in\u2011shelter kits, cash transfers for guardians, and psychosocial support\u2014alongside hard works. Protecting the vulnerable is not a post\u2011script to engineering; it is a core recovery metric."

    "body": "Data show a 10\u201320\u2011day hesitation window in global searches post\u2011disaster, not a collapse. The fix is real\u2011time, credible reassurance: sector\u2011wide fact packs, live accessibility maps, and traveller\u2011generated content answering the only question that matters\u2014\u201cIs Sri Lanka safe now?\u201d\u2014in the places AI chatbots scrape (Reddit, YouTube, X). The tea trade\u2019s rapid return to auction cadence and wildlife/cultural sites reopening are proof points. Silence cedes the narrative; coordinated digital voice reclaims it."

    "body": "ADB approved the next $100m tranche to unbundle the CEB, enable competitive renewables, and clean up balance sheets\u2014crucial to lower tariffs over time. Ditwah\u2019s outages showed single\u2011point failures (e.g., transmission towers) can darken whole districts and knock out water plants. The updated least\u2011cost plan must price climate risk: redundancy in critical corridors, distributed generation, storage, and clear private\u2011sector interconnection rules. Reform that ignores resilience will be penny wise, pound foolish."

    "title": "The return of microfinance regulation risks missing the point\u2014again",
    "body": "A revived Microfinance and Credit Regulatory Authority Bill drew fire for sparing large licensed finance companies while bringing community credit into a heavy compliance net, and for expanding CRIB\u2019s reach without consumer safeguards. Given the debt distress history, a tiered regime makes sense: cap effective interest rates, ban seizure of social transfers, limit multiple loans, and exempt small mutuals from big\u2011bank rules while enforcing fair\u2011collection codes across the board. Regulating the innocent while ignoring the systemic is policy theatre."

    "title": "VAT and governance reforms should not be parked for the weather",
    "body": "Standardising VAT invoices from 2026, digitising audit trails, and lowering thresholds will widen the net just as MSMEs struggle to recover. The way through is phased onboarding: free e\u2011invoicing tools, grace periods, training via chambers, and targeted relief where Ditwah hit hardest. In parallel, organisations must confront fraud\u2011enabling cultures\u2014hierarchy, silence, and conflicted relationships\u2014that waste resources needed for recovery. Controls that fit local norms work better than imported checklists."

    "title": "Rebuilding must respect topography, not nostalgia",
    "body": "Engineers and ecologists converged on the same prescriptions: enforce no\u2011build zones on red\u2011listed slopes and widened river margins, restore riparian buffers and wetlands, remove pine on montane catchments, and adopt \u2018sponge landscape\u2019 urban drainage. Where resettlement is unavoidable\u2014especially above 5,000 ft\u2014guarantee land titles, livelihoods access and services, not just walls and roofs. Building back the way we were is a promise to flood again."

    "body": "Visits and forums\u2014from Viet Nam\u2019s trade mission to NASSCOM\u2019s CEO huddle\u2014signal that deal flow can coexist with disaster response. To convert interest into FDI, Sri Lanka must unclog approvals (single\u2011window at the Port City and BOI), publish a credible pipeline (data centres, logistics, agro\u2011processing, renewables), and guarantee contract stability. A steady stock market rebound and marquee corporate results help; what seals decisions are predictable rules and serviced land."

The only sustainable response is institutional, not ad hoc: early\u2011warning that triggers action automatically; district command with private\u2011sector plug\u2011ins; a climate\u2011aware grid and water plan; a transparent, audited reconstruction fund; and a results office that publishes monthly progress.
