    "body": "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake\u2019s four\u2011hour Budget pitches fiscal discipline under the IMF programme and a medium\u2011term 7% growth target. Revenue is to rise to 15.3% of GDP and the deficit to narrow to about 5.2%, with digitalisation, trade facilitation and public\u2013private partnerships (PPP) as growth levers. Business lobbies welcomed policy predictability and some long\u2011sought fixes (trade single window, SOE reform laws, investor visas, 5G rollout). But they also warned the growth maths is thin without faster execution, a clearer investment\u2011incentive package and stronger tax administration. Critics called the 7% target optimistic, flagged a squeeze on SMEs from a lower VAT registration threshold (Rs. 36m) and queried whether capital spending is sufficient to lift productivity. The Budget\u2019s political economy is now explicit: keep the IMF onside while trying to ease cost\u2011of\u2011living pain without derailing consolidation. \ud83d\udcca"

The Government cites delimitations as the blocker; opponents counter that Parliament (where the NPP holds two\u2011thirds) could legislate a return to the prior system as an interim step. ITAK (Tamil party) also objected to defence\u2011sector nominees for the Office of Reparations, arguing it would erode community trust in redress. The longer PCs stay under gubernatorial control, the more devolution looks mothballed\u2014a risk for governance at the periphery and for investor perceptions of predictability beyond Colombo. \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f"

Elsewhere, anti\u2011corruption headlines cut both ways: former Tourism Minister Prasanna Ranatunga was arrested and bailed over an alleged 2021 insurance\u2011broker deal; and the Opposition hammered the Government over a rushed tender for 1,775 double\u2011cabs, alleging a 12\u2011day bid window and tailored specs. The administration\u2019s promise of a cleaner state (and lower perks for officials) will be judged not by rhetoric but by audit trails, prosecutions and tenders that withstand scrutiny. \ud83d\udd75\ufe0f"
