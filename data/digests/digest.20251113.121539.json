    "body": "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake\u2019s 2026 Budget keeps faith with the IMF\u2019s Extended Fund Facility\u2014aiming at a 2.5% primary surplus, revenue of c.15% of GDP and debt at 95% of GDP in 2026\u2014with investor\u2011friendly moves such as an Investment Protection Act and clearer incentives. Yet capital spending remains modest and the big accelerators (trade logistics, energy, skills) hinge on delivery. VAT net-widening (threshold down to Rs. 36m from April 2026) and a proposed plantation wage lift to Rs. 1,750/day from January 2026 aid revenue and equity, but execution risks loom. With Provincial Council elections still in limbo, political devolution\u2014and investor confidence it underwrites\u2014also drifts."

    "title": "Markets cheer the Budget as equities hit records, but credit is fuelling a car boom",
    "body": "The CSE\u2019s All\u2011Share broke through 23,500 on Budget optimism and a Fitch nod to fiscal discipline; turnover stayed brisk. Beneath the rally, Licensed Finance Companies directed about 63% of H1 2025 lending to vehicle\u2011backed loans, while import outflows for autos exceeded $1.4bn. That props up customs and VAT\u2014\ud83d\udcc8\u2014but risks pressuring the rupee and crowding out productive credit. Revenue buoyancy built on imported consumption is a short bridge to sustainable growth."

    "title": "Policy plumbing advances: PPP law, Port City tweaks and a national digital ID are queued",
    "body": "The PPP Act is slated for early 2026 with a screening tool by end\u2011Q1; an Investment Protection Act is being drafted; and amendments to the Strategic Development Projects and Port City laws aim to speed approvals. Port City Colombo is pitched as a regional services hub\u2014including arbitration\u2014if visas, IP registration and expat employment rules are streamlined. The first digital ID cards are targeted for 2026 under the MOSIP framework, with five Indian integrators shortlisted via India\u2019s NISG. The theme is clear: implement, don\u2019t just announce."

    "title": "Exports and SMEs get a policy lift, but the hard yards start at the port gate",
    "body": "Business welcomed Budget nods to a Trade National Single Window, tariff-policy clean\u2011up and SME support, and CACCI\u2019s Colombo summit cast Sri Lanka as a connector in the \u2018Asian Century\u2019. Apparel brands applauded VAT on imported fabrics to level the field. Yet shippers warn that skipped vessel calls at Colombo\u2014due to congestion and slow inter\u2011terminal transfers\u2014are delaying inputs and export dispatches. To cash policy cheques, Sri Lanka must phase out para\u2011tariffs, digitise border agencies and fix port operations."

    "title": "Devolution drifts as Nugegoda readies a protest stage and reconciliation stirs",
    "body": "An Opposition-led \u2018Maha Jana Handa\u2019 rally is set for 21 November, while the Socialist Alliance demanded overdue Provincial Council elections. ITAK urged the President not to stack the Office of Reparations with security\u2011sector appointees. The political theatre highlights a deeper risk: prolonged delays in sub\u2011national polls and transitional justice appointments could chill investor sentiment that the Budget seeks to warm."

    "body": "Sri Lanka backed the Riyadh Declaration on the Future of Tourism at the UNWTO Assembly, pitched an investor\u2011residence visa, and will push destination marketing in 2026. Colombo Port City\u2019s champions tout a cost\u2011competitive arbitration hub and MICE (meetings, incentives, conferences, exhibitions) potential\u2014if legal and administrative bottlenecks are cleared. The bet is a services\u2011led \ud83e\udded that complements goods exports."

    "body": "Cabinet cleared four pilot pipeline\u2011irrigation schemes in dry zones\u2014financed by a $3.3m JFPR grant via ADB and Rs. 1.68bn state funds\u2014to cut water losses and boost yields. On the sustainability scoreboard, firms from banking to testing services picked up Presidential Environment Awards, signalling that ESG is nudging into mainstream practice. Small steps, but the climate\u2011economy link is finally on the policy map."

    "title": "Social policy debates sharpen around welfare, wages and classrooms",
    "body": "The Budget proposes lifting estate wages to Rs. 1,750/day (including a Rs. 200 attendance incentive) from January 2026; business seeks productivity linkages. A minister\u2019s description of the Aswesuma cash grant as \u2018legal begging\u2019 sparked pushback, exposing the tightrope between safety nets and work incentives. Sex education returned to the spotlight: the Archbishop criticised plans, while the Prime Minister (who is also Education Minister) said age\u2011appropriate content would be expert\u2011led to protect children from abuse."

    "body": "The SEC briefed over 150 listed\u2011company directors on duties and liabilities under company law, reinforcing the \u2018tone at the top\u2019 in capital markets. Anti\u2011corruption probes saw a former minister arrested and bailed in an alleged 2021 insurance\u2011procurement case. On narcotics, seven traffickers abroad signalled willingness to surrender, according to the Public Security Minister, dovetailing with the nationwide \u2018Ratama Ekata\u2019 drug\u2011control drive. Accountability\u2014both corporate and criminal\u2014stayed on the front page."
