    "body": "With nearly two million people affected and direct physical damage preliminarily estimated at about $4.1 billion (World Bank GRADE), the cyclone is now a macroeconomic event. The ILO reckons up to 374,000 workers are affected and potential monthly earnings losses could reach $48 million, with rice, fisheries and tea hardest hit. The State has mobilised a Rs. 500 billion supplementary estimate and a \u2018Rebuilding Sri Lanka\u2019 fund; the BOI has set up a 24/7 support unit to unblock import/export and damaged-goods issues for investors. Success will hinge on more than cash: science-led land-use and early warning (NBRO), landslide mitigation rather than ad\u2011hoc resettlement, and credible oversight of spend. The prize is stabilising 2025 growth and reducing the country\u2019s structural exposure to climate shocks; the penalty is deeper output losses and a longer recovery. \ud83c\udf00"

    "body": "External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar\u2019s visit underscored India\u2019s role: Operation Sagar Bandhu flew in medicines and rations, an Indian Army field hospital treated patients, and 228 tons of Bailey bridges helped restore connectivity; India also pledged a $450 m recovery package (including a $100 m grant). The symbolism matters\u2014especially as Sri Lanka reassures tourists in peak season. Europe, Japan and Pakistan also extended assistance, while the EU activated its civil protection mechanism to airlift 83 tonnes of relief. In geopolitics, reliability trumps rhetoric; India\u2019s mix of logistics, finance and political signalling met that standard. \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf3\ud83e\udd1d"

    "body": "Private balance sheets are reinforcing public outlays. Cargills gave Rs. 100 m to the national fund and Rs. 45 m in rations; HNB committed Rs. 100 m and 2,500 relief packs; LOLC launched a three\u2011phase Rs. 400 m programme, from family \u2018super packs\u2019 to rebuilding 200 schools; Sri Lanka Insurance supported 1,000 families; Lion Brewery cleared debris and boats in Biyagama; The Technocity earmarked Rs. 50 m in devices and school infrastructure; Pyramid Wilmar, Tristar UAE, Asriel Marketing and others wrote cheques. The lesson: public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs) can scale relief quickly. The caveat: all flows\u2014corporate and State\u2014must be transparently tracked through the Rebuilding Fund to sustain trust. \ud83d\udcb8"

    "body": "Columns this week highlighted the engineering logic: saturated soils over weak bedrock, adverse bedding planes, and unmanaged drainage make Central Highlands slopes fail. Experts proposed a National Landslide Risk Management Authority, scaled bio\u2011engineering and sub\u2011surface drainage, and moving from blanket \u2018red zones\u2019 to targeted mitigation at upper catchments. Equally, knee\u2011jerk bans on construction above altitude lines or relocating entire districts would be disruptive and unscientific; better to follow the evidence\u2011based National Physical Plan 2050, invest in early warning (in all national languages), and build dry dams and flood bunds where rivers have no reservoirs. \ud83c\udfd4\ufe0f"
