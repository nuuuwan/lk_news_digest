The Cabinet of Ministers on Monday approved the award of a Rs. 1.3 billion contract for the design, development, implementation, and maintenance of a new revenue administration system for the Excise Department, Cabinet Spokesman and Health Minister Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa said yesterday.

He said the contract has been granted, tax-free, to MillenniumIT ESP Ltd. and Metropolitan Technologies Ltd., based on the recommendation of the Procurement Committee.
