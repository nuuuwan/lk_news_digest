Namal’s Krrish case fixed for Feb. over alleged Rs. 70 m misappropriation

The Colombo High Court yesterday fixed 16 February for further proceedings in the case filed against Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Parliamentarian Namal Rajapaksa over the alleged misappropriation of Rs. 70 million linked to the Krrish transaction.

When the matter was taken up before Colombo High Court Judge Nadee Aparna Suwandurugoda, the prosecution handed over several documents to the defence, which had been requested earlier to ensure a fair trial.

The Attorney General has instituted criminal proceedings against Rajapaksa in relation to the alleged misappropriation of funds provided by Krrish Lanka Ltd., an Indian real estate company.

According to the indictments, the Rs. 70 million had been granted for the development of rugby in Sri Lanka. The prosecution alleges that the funds were misappropriated, leading to the charges now before the High Court.
