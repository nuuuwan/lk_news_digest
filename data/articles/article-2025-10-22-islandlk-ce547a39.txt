SACEP regional headquarters opens in Colombo: A Green investment in South Asia’s sustainable future

Sri Lanka strengthened its position as South Asia’s environmental and sustainability hub with the opening of the regional headquarters of the South Asia Co-operative Environment Programme (SACEP) in Colombo — a state-of-the-art facility that embodies the region’s commitment to green growth and climate resilience.

The new headquarters, situated at Nawala, was declared open by Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya, with Minister of Environment Dr. Dammika Patabendi, World Bank officials and Secretary to the Ministry of Environment K. R. Uduwawala in attendance. Constructed with World Bank financial and technical support under the Plastic Free Rivers and Seas for South Asia (PLEASE) initiative, the project is seen as a major step in advancing sustainable infrastructure investment in the region.

“This headquarters is not merely a building; it is a regional symbol of cooperation and innovation, said Prime Minister Amarasuriya.

“South Asia’s environmental future depends on collective action, shared technology and responsible investment. The SACEP regional headquarters demonstrates that sustainability and development can go hand in hand.”

The 1,610-square-meter complex is designed in accordance with LEED Gold Certification standards, a globally recognized benchmark for energy-efficient and environmentally responsible buildings. The facility integrates solar panels that generate 20 percent of its total energy consumption, efficient waste management systems and inclusive design principles — making it one of the most advanced green government buildings in the region.

Highlighting Sri Lanka’s leadership in environmental cooperation, Minister of Environment Dr. Dammika Patabendi said the new facility places the country at the heart of South Asia’s sustainability dialogue.

“As SACEP’s host nation, Sri Lanka now offers a modern, eco-friendly headquarters that will enhance regional coordination and policy alignment. This is an investment in our shared environmental and economic future, he noted.

The World Bank, which played a key role in financing the project, described the facility as a “flagship example of climate-smart infrastructure.”

“The SACEP headquarters demonstrates how targeted investments in sustainability can generate economic value, foster innovation, and strengthen resilience across borders, a World Bank representative said, adding that the Bank remains committed to expanding its environmental portfolio in South Asia.

Established in 1982, SACEP serves as the regional intergovernmental platform for environmental cooperation among eight South Asian nations — Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Its work spans climate change mitigation, biodiversity conservation, marine litter reduction and sustainable resource management.

According to Environment Secretary K. R. Uduwawala, the facility will also serve as an incubator for green innovation and capacity building.

“This new regional headquarters enables SACEP to lead with data, technology, and collaboration — promoting initiatives that not only protect ecosystems but also drive green jobs and investment opportunities across South Asia, he explained.
