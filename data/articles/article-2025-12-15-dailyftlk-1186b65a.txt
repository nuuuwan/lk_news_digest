The Sri Lanka–Maldives Business Council (SLMLBC) has extended its deepest appreciation to the Government and the people of the Maldives for the extraordinary solidarity and generosity extended to Sri Lanka in the aftermath of the recent cyclone.

Sri Lanka received approximately $ 2 million in financial assistance and $ 1.2 million worth of tuna cans, contributed collectively by the Government of the Maldives, private sector institutions, Maldivian citizens, and the Sri Lankan expatriate community in the Maldives. This substantial support will directly aid families and communities severely impacted by the disaster.

“This remarkable act of compassion reflects the enduring friendship and shared values that unite our two nations,” said Sri Lanka-Maldives Business Council President Sanjeewa Perera. “At a time of need, the Maldives has demonstrated unwavering solidarity with Sri Lanka, and we are truly humbled by this heartfelt support.”

The council said the Maldives’ example stands as a powerful example of unity and shared goodwill and acknowledged the dedication and leadership of Sri Lanka’s High Commissioner to the Maldives M.R. Hassan, Maldivian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka Masood Imad.

“As President of SLMLBC, together with our Executive Committee and the entire membership, I wish to convey our heartfelt gratitude to all who contributed to this noble effort,” Perera added. “This gesture of solidarity is a testament to the strong, enduring bond and mutual support that define the relationship between Sri Lanka and the Maldives.”
