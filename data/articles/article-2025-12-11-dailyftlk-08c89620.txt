The United States has extended significant humanitarian assistance to Sri Lanka to support nationwide relief efforts in the aftermath of Cyclone Ditwah, which caused severe damage across multiple regions.

The assistance was presented by US Ambassador Julie Chung, USAF Lt. Col. Van Pinxteren, and Defence Attaché Matthew House.

As part of the support package, the United States has provided two C-130 aircraft, two bowsers, and a forklift to strengthen logistics capacities needed to transport humanitarian supplies to affected communities in the Northern, Eastern and Central regions. Additionally, 60 personnel from the US Air Force have been deployed to assist with relief operations.

Sri Lankan officials expressed their gratitude for the timely support, which will bolster ongoing national efforts to reach displaced families and restore essential services in cyclone-affected areas.
