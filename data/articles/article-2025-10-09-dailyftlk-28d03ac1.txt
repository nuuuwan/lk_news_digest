CEB–Govt. talks collapse; staff to escalate trade union action

Talks between the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and the Government over the ongoing restructuring process have broken down, prompting electricity trade unions to intensify their month-long work-to-rule campaign.

Union representatives said they have decided to suspend all cooperation with officials from the Ministry of Power, the CEB Director General, and others involved in the restructuring initiative.

“We will not take part in discussions or participate in any activity connected to the restructuring process. Despite our continued trade union action for more than a month, the Government has neither resolved the issues nor held meaningful talks with us. Our campaign will continue and be further intensified until the authorities respond,” a union spokesperson told the media.

Electricity sector unions have been protesting against the restructuring of the CEB, claiming the process is being carried out without transparency or consultation with employees.
