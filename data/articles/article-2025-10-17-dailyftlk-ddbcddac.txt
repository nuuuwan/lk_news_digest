Lanka Aluminium boosts retail sector with credit terms, credit card offerings

Lanka Aluminium Industries PLC has announced that credit terms and credit card payment facilities are offered at the company’s retail outlets being established islandwide to boost the aluminium extrusion supplies market.

Lanka Aluminium Industries PLC Chairman Dinal Peiris  said: “We have observed a growing demand for the more generic architectural and hardware sections, which are usually sold in retail outlets. In order to capitalise on this opportunity, we are offering credit terms and credit card payment facilities to selected customers through our retail network.”

Lanka Aluminium has provided its architectural aluminium extrusion solutions to some of the most prestigious and iconic buildings in the country, including those that meet international standards. The company continues to assist clients by providing tech support, wind load calculations, and assembly drawings.

In the absence of growth in the high-rise segment, the company has decided to focus on the retail segment.

Lanka Aluminium Industries PLC Head of Retail Susantha Paranagama said: “We plan to use our strong technical skills and large selection of doors and windows to assist customers, especially home builders, to select the most appropriate product and not necessarily the most expensive one.”

“This helps the customer save money and get the best product, thereby building trust and confidence. We also provide them with shop and assembly drawings and introduce suitable fabricators,” he added. “We are confident that offering these services and facilities, free of charge, to our valued customers will enable us to build long-term relationships, thereby increasing the usage of aluminium doors and windows, especially amongst house builders.”
