Her artistic direction and signature elegance brought a touch of international glamour to the runway, elevating the event to an unforgettable spectacle.

Further underscoring SLIIT’s vision of empowering young talent, VogueFest’25 introduced four open competition categories: Upcoming Designer, Upcoming Model and Young Fashion Entrepreneur of the Year, offering aspiring creatives a vibrant stage to shine and connect with industry leaders.

The distinguished judging panel brought together some of Sri Lanka’s most respected and accomplished professionals in the fields of fashion, design, and beauty, including Michael Wijesooriya, Couture Designer, Bridal Designer, and Hair & Makeup Artist; Prabath Samarasooriya, Professional Artist, Textile Designer, and Senior Lecturer in Design; Thimani Rodrigo, Designer and Head of Design at Tanash Studios & Atelier; Piyumal Sithum, Sri Lankan model, fitness coach, and entrepreneur, and 1st Runner-Up at Manhunt International 2025; Hasini Gunasekara, Director of the Naturals salon chain and Founder of the International Academy of Beauticians in Sri Lanka; and Romiane Alweis, former Miss Earth Sri Lanka 2020, Miss Environmental Sri Lanka 2023, and 2nd Runner-Up at the Miss International Environmental Pageant.
