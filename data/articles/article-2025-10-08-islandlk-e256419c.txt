The Colombo Academy of Hospitality Management (CAHM) celebrated Tourism Day 2025 with a vibrant event designed to inspire the next generation of tourism leaders. Organized by students from the Advanced Diploma of Travel & Tourism Management, the event aligned with the United Nations World Tourism Day theme, “Tourism and Sustainable Transformation”, highlighting the crucial role of youth in building an equitable, inclusive, and environmentally responsible tourism industry.

The day brought together industry experts, university students, and high schoolers for a dynamic program of insightful discussions, cultural showcases, and collaborative activities. A key highlight was a panel discussion on the role of youth in sustainable tourism.

Distinguished panelists included D.K.R. Dharmapala (Chief Executive Officer, Lanka Sportreizen), Sanchitha Uduwavidana (Director of Human Resources, City of Dreams Sri Lanka), Menik Paranawithane (Manager – Marketing Communications & B2C, DTH Travel), Shaleen Shanthikumar (Director/General Manager, The Serendipity Collection & The Serendipity Experiences), and Thushni De Silva (Travel Specialist and Co-founder of the Women in Travel Collective). The discussion explored how young people can champion sustainable practices, sports tourism, wellness travel, and innovative entrepreneurship to shape the industry’s future. Panelists emphasized that youth have the power to drive positive change by embracing creativity, technology, and responsible practices. The session concluded with a call to action for participants to harness their passion and fresh perspectives to build a tourism industry that protects the planet, preserves culture, and fosters meaningful global connections.

Adding to the day’s learning experience, Jude Malindra, Tourism Consultant and Co-founder of Mindful Retreats Sri Lanka, delivered an engaging session on wellness tourism. He highlighted that wellness travel should uplift not only individuals but also entire communities. Sharing strategies on co-creating experiences with local populations, revenue-sharing models, and authentic Ayurvedic and indigenous medicine practices, he emphasized, “True wellness empowers and uplifts entire communities by honoring indigenous medicine—not exploiting them.”

Beyond discussions, the event celebrated Sri Lanka’s rich heritage. Guests enjoyed traditional performances, while an inter-university quiz challenged participants’ knowledge of tourism trends and sustainability. CAHM’s culinary and hospitality students also showcased their talents by preparing and serving a variety of authentic Sri Lankan delicacies, offering attendees a true taste of the island’s culture.

Tourism Day 2025 at CAHM sent a clear message that young minds are central to transforming the future of tourism. By embracing sustainable practices, innovation, and a strong sense of community, the next generation is well-positioned to lead the industry toward resilience, inclusivity, and long-term success.
