Sampath Bank records 21% increase in PAT for the nine-month period

Sampath Bank maintained strong growth in the first nine months of 2025, recording a 21% increase in Profit After Tax (PAT) to Rs. 21.5 billion. This robust performance came despite a challenging interest rate environment that saw its Net Interest Income contract by 6%.

The bank’s profit growth was primarily driven by two key factors: a significant 107% surge in non-fund based income, including fees from cards and trade, and a substantial 62% reduction in impairment charges. This reflects improved credit quality and a stronger repayment capacity among its customers.

Demonstrating resilience, the bank’s gross loan book expanded by 18.9%, surpassing the Rs. 1 trillion milestone. Meanwhile, customer deposits grew robustly, strengthening its funding base.

Sampath Bank also confirmed its capital strength, maintaining all regulatory capital ratios well above the required minimums, even after being designated a systemically important bank. The bank’s commitment to sustainability was recognized internationally when it was named “Best Bank for ESG in Sri Lanka” at the Euromoney Awards 2025.
