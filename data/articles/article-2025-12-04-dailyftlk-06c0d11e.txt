CHEC Port City Colombo extends Rs. 10 m and on-ground support to recovery efforts following Cyclone

As Sri Lanka confronts the heartbreaking aftermath of Cyclone Ditwah, one of the most devastating natural disasters in the nation’s recent history, the country has witnessed people and organisations coming together in an extraordinary show of solidarity. With thousands of families displaced, communities destroyed, and critical infrastructure severely damaged, CHEC Port City Colombo Ltd., has stepped forward to extend critical financial and on-ground assistance.

In response to this urgent national emergency and unprecedented humanitarian crisis, the company has donated Rs. 10 million to the Government’s newly established ‘Rebuilding Sri Lanka’ Fund, a statutory mechanism under the Presidential Secretariat dedicated to long-term reconstruction, rehabilitation, and restoration of critical infrastructure.

“In this time of deep national sorrow, our hearts are with every Sri Lankan family affected by this tragedy,” said CHEC Port City Colombo Ltd., Managing Director Xiong Hongfeng. “Sri Lanka has been a trusted partner for decades. Today, we stand with its people, not merely as developers, but as friends, neighbours, and long-term partners committed to rebuilding lives and communities.”

The donation was officially handed over by Xiong Hongfeng to Finance Ministry Secretary to the Treasury Dr. Harshana Suriyapperuma. The Colombo Port City Economic Commission (CPCEC) facilitated the process as the regulatory authority for Port City Colombo.

Beyond financial support, CHEC Port City Colombo Ltd., has mobilised a fleet of 12 critical disaster-response machinery, including loaders, excavators, backhoes, flatbed trucks, and dump trucks, ready for rapid deployment to government-designated areas to accelerate debris clearance, restore access, and support emergency rescue operations.

Leveraging decades of global expertise in infrastructure development in Sri Lanka, the company is also offering specialised engineering support for emergency bridge repairs, road reconstruction, and technical assistance to reconnect isolated communities.

In addition to equipment and technical support, all required skilled personnel are being fully sourced and deployed by CHEC Port City Colombo Ltd., to ensure uninterrupted, on-ground assistance where it is needed most.

CHEC Port City Colombo Ltd.’s contribution reinforces its enduring partnership with Sri Lanka, reflecting a commitment to respond to moments of profound crisis with decisive action and empathy.
