Public sector officials complete China-funded capacity development programs

Over 800 officials from Government and semi-Government institutions in Sri Lanka took part in capacity development programs in the People’s Republic of China this year, and a reception to honour the returning participants was held on Thursday at the Moonwalk Ballroom of the Lotus Tower.

The ceremony, jointly organised by the Chinese Embassy in Sri Lanka and the China Aid Training Alumni Association, brought together a distinguished gathering, including Chinese Ambassador Xi Jiahong and First Lady Jin Qiang. Labour Minister and Finance Deputy Minister Dr. Anil Jayantha Fernando, Treasury Secretary Dr. Harshana Suryapperuma, and a large number of senior officials also attended the event.

Held under the theme “Global Governance Initiatives”, the reception featured a keynote address by Ambassador Xi Jiahong, who emphasised China’s long-standing commitment to supporting Sri Lanka’s development efforts. Dr. Fernando and the President of the China Aid Training Alumni Association Wimala Gunaratne, delivered remarks on behalf of the Government of Sri Lanka.

Speakers underscored the decades-long cooperation between the two countries and highlighted the growing importance of strengthening these ties in areas of training, knowledge sharing and institutional development.

They also stressed that enhancing Sri Lanka’s human capital through international capacity-building programs is vital as the country advances its economic recovery and reform agenda.

Officials who had undergone training in fields such as public administration, port management, modern agriculture, and digital technology shared insights on how their newly acquired skills are being applied to support national development initiatives.

The China Aid Training Alumni Association comprising Sri Lankan public sector officers who have completed training in China was recognised as a valuable platform for transforming these experiences into practical contributions for the country.
