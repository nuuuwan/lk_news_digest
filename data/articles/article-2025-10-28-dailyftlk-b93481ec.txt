Hayleys Plantations has entered into a landmark partnership with Solidaridad Network Asia and its Sri Lankan partner Nucleus Foundation to advance regenerative agriculture and carbon insetting programs across its estates.

The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), signed alongside other plantation sector companies, represents the next phase in the sustainability journey of the member companies of Hayleys Plantations, Kelani Valley Plantations PLC (KVPL), Talawakelle Tea Estates PLC (TTE PLC) and Horana Plantations PLC (HPL).

Resected industry veteran and Hayleys Plantations Managing Director Dr. Roshan Rajadurai explained how this latest milestone will serve to further reinforce the Sri Lanka’s position at the international forefront of regenerative, climate-smart, ethical agriculture.

“Our mission at Hayleys Plantations is to help lead the transformation of the Sri Lankan plantation industry into dynamic, resilient, profitable agri-businesses that can serve as a global beacon for sustainable and ethical production. The mainstreaming of regenerative agriculture practices is central to this long-term vision,” he said.

“Our partnership with Solidaridad will further enhance our governance and sustainability frameworks, which in turn will empower our companies to deliver greater tangible value for our employees, smallholder partners, communities and global customers,” Dr. Rajadurai added.

In 2024, KVPL’s Halgolla Estate became the first tea estate in the world to receive regenagri certification, demonstrating its dedication to embedding regenerative principles, including restoring soil health, enhancing biodiversity, sequestering carbon and advancing holistic farming models.

Under the new partnership, all three companies will expand regenagri protocols across more estates, enhancing traceability, competitiveness and supply chain transparency.

The estates will also deploy regenagri carbon insetting programs, generating verified Carbon Removal Units (CRUs) to access global carbon markets.

Carbon insetting is a strategy for companies to reduce their carbon footprint by investing in emissions-reduction projects within their own supply chains or value chains, rather than buying external credits. This can include initiatives like implementing renewable energy, improving energy efficiency, or funding sustainable agriculture and reforestation projects

Such initiatives are expected to strengthen Sri Lanka’s positioning as a sustainable sourcing destination for tea and other agricultural commodities. Digital agriculture tools such as hyperlocal weather monitoring, soil and leaf testing and biodiversity mapping will support data-led decision-making.

These initiatives will be aligned with global sustainability regulations, including the EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) and Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD), positioning Sri Lanka’s tea industry ahead of emerging compliance requirements.

Regenerative agriculture provides a practical pathway between conventional practices and full organic conversion, combining productivity with environmental and social responsibility. For Hayleys Plantations, it contributes to improved soil health, ecosystem health and the continued recognition of Sri Lanka’s sustainably sourced, high-quality teas trusted by discerning global markets.
