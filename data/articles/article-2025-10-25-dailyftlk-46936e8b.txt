Firstdoctor pioneers  digital healthcare innovation

As Sri Lanka accelerates its digital transformation, Firstdoctor is redefining healthcare innovation with the launch of a cloud-based doctor booking and telemedicine platform. This advancement signifies a decisive move towards modern, technology-driven healthcare delivery, amplifying the nation’s digital health landscape.

Moving beyond traditional hospital-bound systems, Firstdoctor’s Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) delivers a scalable, secure, and cost-efficient solution for both medical professionals and patients. By eliminating the need for expensive infrastructure, even individual doctors and small clinics can now digitise their practices, manage online consultations, and issue digital prescriptions all powered by a robust and secure cloud architecture.

The platform integrates a full suite of digital tools, including real-time doctor booking, scheduling, secure video consultations, and patient history, creating a seamless patient experience while enabling healthcare providers to operate independently across Sri Lanka and beyond.

As Sri Lanka advances its adoption of digital public services, healthcare has become a key pillar of national transformation. Firstdoctor complements this vision by providing a doctor-first, patient-centred digital ecosystem that enhances accessibility and operational efficiency. The model also opens new possibilities for medical tourism, allowing international patients to access Sri Lankan medical expertise remotely before travelling for specialised treatment, a valuable step in strengthening Sri Lanka’s position as a trusted healthcare destination in South Asia.

Firstdoctor Co-Founder Janaka Jayalath said: “Our goal is to make healthcare simple, secure, and affordable for every Sri Lankan. We’ve built a platform that gives patients access to doctors anytime, anywhere, while helping medical professionals modernise their practices affordably and efficiently.”

Firstdoctor is a Sri Lankan company fuelled by a direct Canadian investment that brings the world’s best technology to local medical professionals. Its technology meets international standards while complying with Sri Lankan medical regulations and ethical frameworks, ensuring safety, transparency, and trust.

As the global healthcare industry shifts towards affordable and inclusive models, Sri Lanka is demonstrating that innovation is not the privilege of larger economies. Through platforms like Firstdoctor, the nation is not only advancing its own healthcare landscape but also signalling its readiness to compete on the world stage where digital health and medical tourism converge to define the future of modern care.
