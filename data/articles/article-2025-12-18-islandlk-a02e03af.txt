Omega Line crowned overall Best Exporter of the Year at Presidential Export Awards 2024/25

Sri Lanka’s largest apparel exporter to Europe also clinched three other national titles

Omega Line has secured an unprecedented quadruple victory at the Presidential Export Awards 2024/25, claiming the country’s highest export honour alongside three additional national titles in a landmark achievement for Sri Lanka’s apparel sector.

The Oniverse-owned manufacturer was named Best Exporter of the Year and won three further categories: Best Exporter in Product Diversification, Contributor from the Regions to the Export Supply Chain, and Best Exporter – Apparel (Large Category). The awards, presented by the Sri Lanka Export Development Board under presidential patronage, recognize the nation’s top- performing exporters.

“I believe deeply in human potential, and our success at Omega Line is a testament to that belief,” said Felix A. Fernando, CEO and Managing Director. “The driving force behind these achievements is our happy and content workforce. This recognition honours the dedication of over 7,500 employees across our facilities who have made Omega Line a cornerstone of Sri Lanka’s export economy and validates our commitment to world-class manufacturing and our role in strengthening Sri Lanka’s position in global markets.”

Founded in 1999 as a single facility with 30 employees, Omega Line has grown into one of Sri Lanka’s largest apparel exporters to Europe, producing more than 100 million garments annually from its Sandalankawa and Vavuniya operations. Operating under the Oniverse umbrella (formerly Calzedonia), Omega Line and its associated entities, viz. Sirio, Alpha, Benji invested over USD 450 million in Sri Lanka, with annual export values reaching approximately USD 500 million and yearly shipments exceeding 200 million units.

The company’s Vavuniya facility represents the largest private sector investment in the Northern Province, employing 2,900 people and exemplifying Omega Line’s contribution to regional economic development. The award for Contributor from the Regions to the Export Supply Chain specifically recognizes this impact beyond the commercial capital.
