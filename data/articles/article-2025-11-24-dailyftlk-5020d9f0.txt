Sri Lankan delegation wraps up high-impact trade and investment mission in Canada

A Sri Lankan business delegation, organised by the Sri Lanka–Canada Business Council (SLCBC) of The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, with support from the Canada–Sri Lanka Business Convention (CSLBC), the Canadian High Commission in Sri Lanka, and the High Commission of Sri Lanka in Canada, has concluded a trade and investment mission in Canada from 28 October to 14 November.

The delegation represented the agriculture, IT, finance, tourism, education, and investment consultancy sectors, engaging Canadian business and Government leaders across Toronto, Quebec, Montreal, Saskatchewan, and Vancouver.

The mission commenced in Toronto with a courtesy call on the Consulate and CSLBC leadership. Discussions centred on expanding opportunities in banking, financial services, insurance, agri-tech, and medical tourism, as well as the role of the Consulate in facilitating trade and Canada’s growing interests in Indo-Pacific markets. Plans for an investment forum in Colombo and closer alignment on Canada–Sri Lanka diaspora-led trade and investment initiatives were also explored.

Delegates participated in a Business Forum and sectoral sessions covering tourism, agriculture, IT, education, and women’s entrepreneurship, while the proposed Overseas Citizens of Sri Lanka (OCSL) special visa scheme was also discussed. A networking reception featured the soft launch of the “Asia’s Emerging Economies Expo 2026,” along with recognition from the Legislative Assembly of Ontario for the delegation’s contribution.

In Montreal, discussions with the Honorary Consul of Sri Lanka and Sri Lankan business leaders focused on investor facilitation and promoting the upcoming “Gateway to Growth” trade fair.

In Quebec, delegates representing the education sector attended the Quebec Immigration and Integration Fair 2025, engaging with key stakeholders in international education and talent mobility.

Engagements in Saskatchewan highlighted opportunities for collaboration in food security, agriculture, and resource development. At the Global Institute for Food Security, the SLCBC appointed Dr. Ruben Rajkumar as the Goodwill Ambassador for Saskatchewan, recognising his efforts in strengthening ties with Sri Lanka. Visits to Bioriginal and the University of Saskatchewan revealed promising opportunities in value-added processing, smart agriculture, post-harvest technology, joint research initiatives, and strengthening export capabilities. Further discussions were held with the University of Regina on scholarships, joint degrees, and student mobility programs.

The delegation also met with Toronto city officials on potential collaboration in venture capital, trade exhibitions, and education partnerships.

The mission concluded with clear pathways for expanded economic, academic, and research cooperation, including diaspora-led initiatives, joint innovation projects, and sector-based partnerships.

Delegation leader and SLCBC President M.H.K.M. Hameez noted that the visit reinforced Canada’s growing interest in Sri Lanka’s strengths and created practical openings for long-term collaboration. He also emphasised that Sri Lanka is the best destination in Asia to grow Canadian businesses in the region. The SLCBC will now work closely with stakeholders in both countries to advance these opportunities toward implementation.
