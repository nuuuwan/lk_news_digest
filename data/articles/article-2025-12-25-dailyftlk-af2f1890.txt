Rhino Roofing rises up to strengthen children’s education

Rhino Roofing Products Ltd., has donated 300 roofing sheets to the Brothers of Charity Learning Disability Services, facilitating the completion of a new classroom building at their Daluwakotuwa centre.

The Brothers of Charity Learning Disability Services is a non-profit organisation dedicated to educating and supporting children and young adults with learning disabilities and special needs. With centres in Ja-Ela, Negombo, Batticaloa, and Daluwakotuwa, the organisation provides education and care to over 120 students across Sri Lanka. The new classroom building at Daluwakotuwa aims to create a safer, more conducive learning environment.

Recognising the critical role that education plays in empowering every child, Rhino Roofing stepped forward to bridge this gap. The donation of 300 roofing sheets will now allow the construction of the new classroom to be completed, ensuring that children with learning disabilities have a safe, permanent space to learn and grow.

This contribution is part of Rhino Roofing’s broader mission to give back to communities and champion sustainable and socially responsible initiatives. By supporting the Brothers of Charity Learning Disability Services, Rhino continues to demonstrate how businesses can play a vital role in fostering social development and enhancing the quality of life for all.
