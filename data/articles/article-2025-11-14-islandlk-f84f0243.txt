DFCC Bank marks 100th Financial Literacy Programme for migrant employees

Recently, at DFCC Bank’s Kurunegala Branch, migrant employees and their families gathered to talk about money; not how to earn it, but how to make it last. The occasion marked DFCC Bank’s 100th Financial Literacy Programme, a meaningful milestone in a national effort to build financial resilience among those who work overseas.

For years, the Bank has been running sessions that teach budgeting, saving, and responsible remittance practices. The idea is simple: help Sri Lankans abroad manage their income with confidence, and help their families back home turn that income into opportunity.

The event, attended by Central Bank Deputy Governor J. P. R. Karunaratne and Senior Deputy Inspector General (SDIG) in charge of the North Western Province Dr. Ajith Rohana, also launched “Rata Rekiyawata Aruthak”, a plainspoken guidebook for first-time migrants. It explains how to plan expenses, avoid debt traps, and use formal banking channels safely – lessons that could decide whether hard work abroad leads to lasting security at home.

“Reaching our 100th Financial Literacy Programme represents the hundreds of lives we have impacted and the communities we have empowered,” said Anton Arumugam, Senior Vice President for Offshore Banking, Remittance and Business Development. ” The migrant employee population is a cornerstone of Sri Lanka’s economy, and through initiatives like this, DFCC Bank continues to guide them toward secure remittance practices and long-term financial wellbeing.”

The programme has reached towns from Batticaloa to Tangalle, often in partnership with the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment and private agencies. Alongside workshops, DFCC Bank’s RataViru accounts – offered in both rupees and dollars – give families reliable access to earnings sent from abroad.
