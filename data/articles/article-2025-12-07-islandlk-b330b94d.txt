Hemas Consumer Brands recognised as ‘Overall Winner’ at JASTECA Awards 2025

Hemas Consumer Brands (HCB), one of Sri Lanka’s leading FMCG company, was honoured with the prestigious title of “Overall Winner” at the JASTECA Awards 2025. This recognition reaffirms HCB’s position as a national benchmark in operational excellence (lean management), driven by its influential adoption of Japanese 5S and Kaizen practices.

Standing out among a highly competitive field of multinational corporations and local enterprises of all scales, HCB was celebrated for its consistent delivery of best-in-class performance, rooted in a bottom-up performance culture.

Organized by the Japan Sri Lanka Technical and Cultural Association, the JASTECA Awards have been the pinnacle of operational excellence recognition in Sri Lanka since 1996. They honour organizations that embody Japanese principles of quality, productivity, employee engagement, and corporate social responsibility.

Sabrina Esufally, Managing Director of Hemas Consumer Brands, commented: “Being named the Overall Winner at JASTECA 2025, among the best organizations in Sri Lanka, is an immense honour—especially as the awards return after a five-year hiatus. This recognition celebrates our operational excellence, achieved through our people’s relentless pursuit of perfection and commitment to eliminating waste. It also reinforces our purpose of enriching lives through products that are not only of the highest quality but are made responsibly, sustainably, and efficiently.”
