Cyberbullying (silent predator): A modern menace and Sri Lanka’s struggle to overcome it

In today’s hyperconnected world, digital technology has become integral to how we socialise, learn, work, and share ideas. However, as with every tool, there is a darker side: cyberbullying, harassment, intimidation, or abuse carried out via digital platforms. This insidious form of bullying, which crosses time zones and screens, is increasingly harming individuals’ mental health, reputations, and even lives. In Sri Lanka, cyberbullying is not an isolated problem: a growing number of cases, public debates, and even tragic incidents have shown how vulnerable many are online.

The digital world was once hailed as a space of connection, creativity, and opportunity. However, for many Sri Lankans today, especially young people, the screen has become a stage for torment. Cyberbullying, the silent predator lurking behind smartphones and computer screens, is fast becoming one of the most urgent social issues of our time.

Unlike traditional bullying, cyberbullying is not bound by time or space. It follows its victims into their bedrooms, study halls, and workplaces. A cruel comment posted at midnight, a doctored image shared in seconds, or a rumour blasted across Facebook groups can shatter a reputation overnight.

And, the torment doesn’t stop at the screen. It seeps into mental health, friendships, and sometimes even life itself. In April 2025, the tragic suicide of 16-year-old Dilshi Amshika in Colombo stirred national grief. While the case was complex, reports pointed to persistent online humiliation and harassment as a contributing factor. Her story is just one of many that illustrate the deep scars cyberbullying can leave.

Sri Lanka’s rapid digital growth has been a double-edged sword. More than 12 million citizens are now connected to the internet, and social media has become part of daily life. However, with this connectivity has come vulnerability.

According to Sri Lanka CERT, nearly 2,000 incidents of cyberbullying were officially reported in 2024 alone, nearly half involving sexual harassment online. Women in public life, politicians, journalists, activists are frequent targets, facing gendered insults, threats, and defamation campaigns.

Teenagers are especially at risk. During the pandemic, when schooling shifted online, incidents spiked. Harassment moved from playgrounds into WhatsApp groups and gaming chats, leaving children without safe spaces. The cruelty often hides behind anonymous profiles, making perpetrators harder to track. Victims, on the other hand, are left with sleepless nights, anxious mornings, and little faith in justice. One Colombo undergraduate recalls how a private photo was altered and circulated across campus groups. “It felt like my life was over,” she said. “Everywhere I went, I felt eyes judging me.” A female politician described how anonymous trolls bombarded her social media with sexualised memes, false accusations, and threats to her family. “It was not just about silencing me. It was about destroying me,” she told a rights group.

These stories are not exceptions. They are the everyday reality of a nation caught between digital promise and digital peril.

Sri Lanka has not been idle. The Online Safety Act of 2023 marked a turning point, providing a legal framework to tackle harmful online content, from cyberbullying to disinformation. Cases have already been filed under the Act, signalling that online harassment is no longer a grey zone.

Other tools exist to the Computer Crimes Act and sections of the Penal Code but they were designed for an earlier era and often fail to capture the nuances of online abuse. Critics, however, warn that the Online Safety Act is a double-edged sword. While it empowers victims, its broad language could also be misused to suppress free speech. Balancing protection with freedom remains one of the country’s toughest challenges.

Legal reforms alone cannot end cyberbullying. Awareness is just as vital. Schools are slowly weaving digital literacy into curricula, teaching children how to protect privacy, report abuse, and treat others with respect online. NGOs and youth groups are stepping in with workshops and helplines.

However, the reach is uneven. In rural areas, digital education remains scarce. Parents and teachers, often less digitally savvy than their children, are unsure how to guide them. Silence and shame still prevent many victims from speaking up.

If Sri Lanka is to truly overcome cyberbullying, it must take a multi-pronged approach:

Strengthen Enforcement: Police and courts need trained cybercrime units and fast-track systems for complaints.

Empower Schools: Every school should have policies, counsellors, and peer-support systems to address online harassment.

Promote Digital Literacy: From Colombo classrooms to village community halls, citizens must learn how to be safe and respectful online.

Platform Responsibility: Social media companies must respond faster to takedown requests and ban repeat offenders.

Cultural Change: Most importantly, society must foster empathy. Every post, comment, and share should reflect the principle: *the person on the other side of the screen is human, too.

Cyberbullying is more than a technical crime it is a cultural wound. To heal it, laws, schools, parents, youth, media, and tech companies must all play their part. Sri Lanka stands at a crossroads. We can allow the digital world to become a space of cruelty and division, or we can reshape it into one of compassion and dignity. As one teenager put it during a school awareness workshop: “We don’t need a kinder internet. We need kinder people using the internet.”

As the digital landscape continues to evolve, developed nations are pioneering innovative strategies to combat cyberbullying transforming prevention and protection into a shared societal responsibility. These new trends combine technology, education, and legislation to address the root causes and long-term impacts of online harassment.

One significant trend is the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning into social media platforms. Countries like the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia have collaborated with tech companies to develop algorithms that can detect abusive language, hate speech, and harassment patterns in real time. For example, platforms such as Instagram and TikTok now employ predictive AI systems that flag potentially harmful comments before they are even posted, giving users a chance to reconsider or edit their messages. This proactive model shifts the focus from punishment to prevention, a direction Sri Lanka can also pursue through collaboration with local digital platforms.

Another progressive approach comes from education-driven interventions. Finland and Canada have embedded “digital citizenship” and “empathy education” into school curricula, teaching students not only how to stay safe online but also how to behave responsibly and compassionately in digital spaces. Programmes like “Be Internet Awesome” by Google and “Respect Me” in the UK provide interactive lessons and games that nurture ethical online behaviour from an early age. Such initiatives remind us that curbing cyberbullying is not merely a technological challenge but a moral and cultural one.

Legislation has also evolved in promising ways. In New Zealand, the Harmful Digital Communications Act (2015) empowers victims to request immediate removal of abusive content and ensures swift investigation through a dedicated cyber safety authority. Similarly, the European Union’s Digital Services Act (2024) mandates transparency and accountability from major platforms regarding harmful content moderation a legal precedent that ensures both corporate and individual responsibility.

Lastly, there is a growing emphasis on mental health support for victims and perpetrators alike. Many Western nations now link cybercrime units with psychological counselling services, offering confidential online therapy and peer support networks.

If Sri Lanka adopts a combination of these strategies technological monitoring, empathetic education, firm legislation, and mental healthcare it can move toward a safer digital future. The fight against the silent predator of cyberbullying demands not only awareness but also innovation, empathy, and collective commitment.
