The Prime Minister’s Office yesterday said that Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya visited her alma mater, Hindu College of the University of Delhi, during her official visit to India, where a new research facility was inaugurated in her honour.

The new “Harini Amarasuriya Social & Ethnographic Research Lab” was opened in recognition of the Prime Minister’s contributions to education, social reform, and academia. Dr. Amarasuriya, who earned her Bachelor’s degree in Sociology from Hindu College, was received by faculty, administrators, and students at the university.

During her visit, she reflected on her student days and how her time at the institution shaped her commitment to social justice, equality, and education reform. Addressing the students, she said, “Education is not merely about securing individual futures, but about equipping ourselves to transform the futures of others,” while urging them to embrace curiosity, empathy, and critical thinking.

Dr. Amarasuriya also visited NITI Aayog, India’s national policy think tank, for discussions on education, innovation, and governance reforms. The talks focused on India’s transformation through initiatives such as the Atal Innovation Mission, as Sri Lanka advances its own education reform agenda.
