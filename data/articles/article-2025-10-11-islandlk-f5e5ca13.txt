Reflecting on Sumitra Peries’ Gehenu Lamai

The other day, I had the rare privilege of sitting in the darkened hall of Scope Cinema at the Colombo City Centre, watching the newly restored 4K version of Gehenu Lamai (Girls). It was a haunting experience. The film was released 20 years before I was born, at the height of what we may rightly call the golden age of Sri Lankan cinema. To me, the film was never a stranger. I had caught fragments of it on television over the years. But to see it brought to life on the big screen, in all its restored beauty, was to rediscover it as though for the first time.

What lingered most, even in my childhood, was the music. The genius of the late Nimal Mendis, paired with the lilting voice of the late Neela Wickramasinghe in Viyo Gee, carved an unforgettable memory in my heart. That melody was woven into my life not only through the screen but through the sound of my mother’s hands at the piano, playing Viyo Gee across the years at our home. For me, it was more than a mere song. Happily, my mother accompanied me to the show.

I had the good fortune of knowing the late Sumitra Peries, the director of this masterpiece, in the last year of her life. That friendship, fleeting though it was, is a treasure beyond measure. Restoration and relaunching, after all, is not new to me either. In 2022, I myself authored a book and, with the Tulana Media Unit and Hemapriya Kandamby, restored the 16mm film Little Bike Lost (1956). This pioneering outdoor film, which predated Lester James Peries’s Rekava, returned to life that year. Sumitra herself graced the occasion as Guest of Honour. I remember telling her with the utmost sincerity: “I liked your films more than your husband’s.” She only smiled and replied, “Without Lester, I wouldn’t do mine.”

Those words, so simple yet so profound, capture the greatness of the woman. She passed not long after that exchange, but the mark she left upon our nation will not fade. For Sumitra Peries was not merely a filmmaker. She was, and will always remain, a titan of the art — not just in Sri Lanka, but in Asia. Gehenu Lamai, Ganga Addara, Yahalu Yeheli, and her last film, Vaishnavee — which I had the privilege of watching beside her at the KDU auditorium — are not mere films. They are classics. They are monuments. They are works to be enjoyed by the film lover, yes, but also to be studied with reverence by the historian.

In their light, we see not only the beauty of our cinema but the soul of our country.

As a child, watching the poor-quality television print, the weight of these scenes hardly struck me; I found myself listening instead to Neela’s Viyo Gee, distorted on the small screen. But this restoration — carried out by the Film Heritage Foundation in association with the Lester James Peries and Sumitra Peries Foundation — deserves the highest praise. For it allowed me, at last, to absorb, to witness, and to truly enjoy the masterpiece as it was meant to be seen.

based on Karunasena Jayalath’s novel by the same name, was Sumitra’s first film. It was first released in 1978. My friend Uditha Devapriya, who knew her far better, has written with great insight, concluding that Gehenu Lamai carried “a sense of sincerity and honesty often absent from subsequent productions.” That sincerity lay not only in its story, but in the balance of its portrayals. Sumitra’s films did not merely explore feminism in Sri Lankan society; they also gave voice to the traditional, conservative, and submissive woman. Nowhere is this clearer than in the contrast between the sisters: Soma (Jenita Samaraweera), embodying a bold, almost defiant femininity, and Kusum (Vasanthi Chathurani), portraying gentleness and submission. This balance, subtle yet consistent, runs through much of her work, though critics too often overlook it.

The storyline reflects many social dilemmas that were relevant in the 1970s and remain so in the 2020s. Gehenu Lamai builds its narrative on the tender yet troubled love affair between Kusum of a lower class, and Nimal (Ajith Jinadasa), from a higher one. Kusum assists Nimal’s mother, and during his visits home during vacations from the University of Peradeniya, he falls deeply in love with her, and vice versa. Yet her heart is shadowed by doubts over his family’s acceptance. The plot turns when Soma wins a beauty contest, while Kusum and Nimal secretly attend. A few onlookers expose them, and gossip soon reaches Kusum’s mother. Though she praises Kusum’s innocence, she hypocritically deems her unworthy of Nimal. Kusum vows to end the affair and leaves her work. Later, Nimal returns as a graduate teacher to the same school, and while Kusum is now his student, she maintains only a formal distance despite ridicule from others. Soma’s fall — pregnancy and abandonment — further deepens the tragedy, with Kusum raising the child as her own. In the final scenes, while Nimal is welcomed back as a Divisional Revenue Officer (DRO), Kusum is left in the shadows, revealed as having failed university and unemployed.

Now this, we may call the general plot. But Gehenu Lamai is far richer than the story alone. Beneath its narrative lie layers, nuances that too often slip past the eye. Let us begin with what is most apparent: the love between two souls divided by class, and the impossibility of bridging that divide. The scorn and ridicule of the upper class towards the lower, the struggle of the village girl Soma to adapt to the glitter and deception of Colombo, the blindness that love so often inflicts. Sumitra, with her lens, seizes these realities with quiet force. They were controversial then, and they remain so now.

Yet what is overlooked, and what I believe Sumitra achieved most beautifully, is her revelation of femininity, a revelation rare in our cinema before Gehenu Lamai. Look closely at Kusum and her friend Padmini (Shyama Ananda). Their intimacy, their shared innocence, their sisterhood. See how Shyama defends Kusum when mocked by others, how she consoles, advises, and protects her. In one of the most tender scenes, a kiss on the cheek between the two girls speaks volumes: not of scandal, but of affection, solidarity, and the unspoken language of womanhood.

Kusum herself, despite her suffering, is never stripped of her grace. She remains radiant, elegant, and deeply affectionate, a figure both fragile and strong, vulnerable yet luminous. And it is here that Vasanthi Chathurani, at only her first appearance on screen, must be remembered with the highest praise. Forty-seven years on, her performance still glows naturally, unforced, and profound. What touched me deeply was Nimal’s tenderness towards his former love when he returned as a teacher to the village. One would expect resentment, even bitterness, after such a sudden break. But Nimal was different. He went the extra mile — handing Kusum his notes, urging her to take her studies seriously, sensing how distracted and lost she had become. Ajith Jinadasa, who had already shone in Lester’s Madol Duwa (1976), carried that same brilliance into Gehenu Lamai. His portrayal of Nimal — gentle, restrained, yet quietly steadfast — remains a testament to his craft.

While I enjoyed the film for its thematic narrative and nuances expressed, I also found two or three devices Sumitra, the film maker could perhaps be responsible for making this not just an excellent film but a classic. One was the direction of cinematography led by S. Ananda. The restored version brought forward a clear idea of how exactly the visual looked like and the devices Sumitra and Ananda may have adopted to make the audience see their perspective. A technique used repeatedly was the manifestation of emotion in mirrors. This was pre-dominantly seen in film such as Bergman’s Persona  (1966), Scorsese’s Taxi Driver (1976), and Satyajit Ray’s Charulata (1964).

Mirrors are never neutral. They carry the weight of the unsaid. When a character gazes into one, it signals self-confrontation, fractured identity, or feelings unvoiced. In Gehenu Lamai, Sumitra employs this with delicate precision. The reflections carrying suppressed anxieties, longings, and the tension between the life shown to others and the life lived within. The clearest instance is Kusum’s gradual emotional change upon realizing her bond with Nimal had ended once her mother discovered them.

The zoom into faces was another device. From Hitchcock to Spielberg, many directors have used it to reveal sudden shifts. Sumitra tries this, most memorably when Kusum blurts another’s name as Nimal playfully covers her eyes. Yet at times the zoom falters, slightly out of sync with motion, breaking the rhythm. Finally, the recurring Viyo Gee background singing, almost a jingle, accompanies each poignant moment. Though repetitive, Sumitra uses it aptly anchoring emotion in song, giving memory to feeling.

All in all, I felt deeply privileged to witness the restored Gehenu Lamai. To sit in the hall, watching alongside the very cast who once embodied those unforgettable roles—Chathurani, Jinadasa, and others—was not merely a screening. It was witnessing history return to life before our eyes. The restoration, with its luminous clarity, reveals the genius of Sumitra Peries with a freshness that our generation must not overlook. This film must not remain confined to rare occasions or select audiences. The restored Gehenu Lamai deserves to be made widely available, to circulate across theatres, homes, and especially classrooms. Our schools should seize the opportunity to show it to students, encouraging them to critique and reflect on the powerful message it carries—the silent struggles of class, love, and identity that remain timeless. For in films such as this, we do not just see characters; we see ourselves, our society, and the truths we often turn away from.
