Nufloe elevates movement and rehabilitation in Sri Lanka through Pilates

Located in the heart of Colombo, Nufloe is changing how Sri Lankans move, recover, and reconnect with their bodies through Pilates. Established in 2025, Nufloe is the country’s first fully equipped Balanced Body® Pilates studio, setting a new standard in mindful movement, rehabilitation, and boutique fitness. Behind its serene Japandi-inspired interiors and the calm rhythm of curated playlists lies a purpose-driven philosophy to create a space where movement meets medicine, and where every individual, regardless of age or ability, can find strength through movement.

Nufloe is the only Pilates studio in Sri Lanka to offer the full range of Balanced Body® equipment, including the Reformer, Cadillac Trapeze Table, Tower, EXO Chair, Combo Chair, and Spinefitter. This allows clients to experience the same professional-grade quality found in leading studios worldwide. Each piece of apparatus is designed to improve flexibility, strength, and balance while ensuring every session remains low-impact and gentle on the joints. Whether you’re new to Pilates or an experienced mover, each class, whether group, private, or beginner, provides a guided journey towards better posture, deeper core strength, and greater mobility.

Savindya Tissera, founder of Nufloe and professionally trained under the Balanced Body® Pilates teacher training, hails from a corporate background, specialising in strategy and corporate finance. Having been a Pilates practitioner for over 10 years, she believes Pilates is more than a form of exercise; it’s a tool for lifelong health.
