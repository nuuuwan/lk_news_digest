Beyond the Wheel: The Tuktuk as a Tool for Social Empowerment and Passive Income

The rhythmic thrum of the three-wheeler, or tuktuk, is the undeniable soundtrack to life in Sri Lanka. It’s the sound of morning commutes, market runs, and school trips. For decades, this humble vehicle has been the nation’s workhorse, a symbol of mobility and livelihood. But a quiet revolution is underway on the roads of our island, transforming the tuktuk from a simple means of transport into a powerful engine of social empowerment and a source of remarkable passive income.

Following our first article in this series, The Humble Tuk-Tuk: Sri Lanka’s Key to a $372 billion Travel Market, we now delve into the human stories behind this economic shift.

This is not a story about the Colombo Stock Market or the high-stakes real estate market, where passive income has traditionally been the preserve of the wealthy. Instead, this is a grassroots economic success story, where ordinary Sri Lankans are unlocking the potential of an asset they already own, creating stability and opportunity for their families in ways they never thought possible.

In the sun-drenched coastal town of Weligama, P.G. Nissanka has experienced this transformation firsthand. Like many tuktuk owners, his vehicle was his primary source of income. But he has since pivoted his strategy. “I rented out my three-wheeler to a company that re-rents their fleet to tourists, especially from the Western countries,” he explains. The result has been life-changing. “Today I earn about Rs. 60,000 per month without having to drive it or maintain it,” Nissanka says. This transition has turned his vehicle into a consistent, hassle-free source of passive income.

But the story doesn’t end there. Freed from the daily demands of driving, Nissanka’s entrepreneurial spirit flourished. “It has turned out to be a passive income for me while making my life more dynamic because now I have set up a three-wheel repair shop and work there full-time,” he shares with pride. For him, the rise of tuktuk tourism didn’t just provide a steady cheque; it was a catalyst. “Tuktuk tourism has not only increased my income from the three-wheeler but also has given me the opportunity to set up a new business,” he affirms. His story is a powerful example of the ripple effect: one stream of passive income creating the time and capital to launch a new, active enterprise.

Miles away, nestled in the hill country village of Bidunuwewa, Bandarawela, Marie Wijesinghe’s journey showcases the tuktuk’s power as a tool for social security and family empowerment. As a single mother of three, her life was a constant struggle to make ends meet. “Three years ago, from what I saved from my factory job in Bandarawela, I bought a three-wheeler and got my younger brother to operate it and earn an income,” she recounts. Her brother took on the responsibility with dedication, driven by love for his sister and her children.

Then they heard about a new opportunity – a chance to join a program that rents tuktuks to the growing tourist market. “When we heard that our three-wheeler could be rented out for about Rs. 60,000 per month for a reliable company that deploys a fleet of three-wheelers for tuktuk tourism, we also joined the programme,” Marie says.

This decision marked a turning point for her family. The income from the rental provided a level of stability her factory job never could.

“Today, it is bringing me more money to run my family in a more stable way,” she says, relief evident in her voice. The benefits cascaded through her family; her brother was able to find a new job at a tea factory in Badulla, and the overall well-being of her children improved significantly. “We are in a better position today, and the children are healthier and happier,” she shares.

The success of owners like Nissanka and Marie is fueled by a growing global demand from travellers who crave a more authentic and unscripted holiday experience. They are the other side of this equation – the adventurers who are choosing to see Sri Lanka not through the tinted windows of an air-conditioned coach, but from the open-air freedom of a self-drive tuktuk.

John Mackenzie from Sheerness, England, discovered this freedom while exploring the ancient city of Anuradhapura. “This travel mode was great,” he said enthusiastically. “I had total travel freedom and I visited where I fancied. I stopped where I fancied, and I ate food and bought souvenirs as I liked them without being influenced”. His journey was self-directed, immersive, and memorable. “Everything was done according to a plan of no plan,” he joked, summing up the spirit of spontaneous discovery that a tuktuk enables. “I have so many Sri Lankan memories to take home to England. I would urge anyone to experience this ride and what difference it makes”.

This desire for authenticity was echoed by Amelia Smith from Adelaide, Australia. Her philosophy was simple: to truly experience a country, you must immerse yourself in its way of life. “They say, ‘When in Rome, do as the Romans do’, and I travelled in a rented-out three-wheeler with that travel axiom in my mind – “get around the country predominantly in Sri Lankan style while you are in Sri Lanka,” she explained. The experience was visceral and immediate. “I loved the breeze of the countryside more than the circling air in an air-conditioned coach and I knew at every mile post where I was and how the terrain changed every 30-40 kilometers,” Smith observed. For her, this was the only way to truly appreciate the island’s famously diverse landscapes. “That is an amazing thing in Sri Lanka and there is no other way to experience it other than by travelling in a self-drive tuktuk. You are in command of your entire vacation. Isn’t that just nice?” she asked.

For Johanna Hendriks, a public relations professional and social media influencer from Rotterdam, the tuktuk was both an adventure and a professional tool. Initially hesitant, she was convinced by a fellow Dutch family she met in Mirissa and by the professionalism of the rental company she rented from. “I heard about this unique travel experience provided by private rental companies that are not only reliable but also provide emergency services when a rented-out three-wheeler is having a mechanical defect,” she noted, highlighting a key factor in building tourist confidence. As a photographer, the tuktuk unlocked a world of possibilities for her.

“My self-drive tuktuk travel exposed me to hundreds of photo opportunities,” she said. She described capturing globally unique images at Tamba Villas in Thalpe, Galle, amidst lush gardens and palm trees, but it was the cultural element that moved her most. A photograph she took at dawn, of a serene-looking Buddhist monk on his alms round, his saffron robe a stark contrast against the misty morning, as a villager humbly offered a meal, is one she believes could win an award back in the Netherlands. “It was a moment of pure silence and profound grace,” she reflected. “It captured the soul of the country in a single frame.”

These tourist experiences represent the macro picture: a flourishing, innovative segment of Sri Lanka’s tourism industry. But the micro-picture is where the real heart of this story lies. It’s a picture of resilience, entrepreneurship, and newfound stability. “Every kilometer traveled by tourists in a self-drive tuktuk helps distribute tourism income to rural communities” a poignant truth that underscores the direct impact of this model.

This is the hidden growth story of self-drive tuktuk tourism in Sri Lanka. It’s a story where a person, who might never have had the capital to invest in stocks or property, is now earning a reliable passive income from an asset parked in their garden. With an ROI of approximately 25% per annum, it’s more profitable than holding shares in a blue-chip stock on the Colombo Stock Exchange and spreading the wealth to those who truly need it. With every kilometer a visitor travels, with every photograph taken, and with every rupee earned by a family in Weligama or Bandarawela, Sri Lanka Tourism gains invaluable mileage in the world tourism market. The humble tuktuk is no longer just moving people; it’s moving an entire nation forward.
