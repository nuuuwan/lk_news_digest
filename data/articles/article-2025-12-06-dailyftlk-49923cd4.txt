JXG’s Holistic Leadership Summit 2025 champions blueprint for corporate steadiness and human-centred growth

The panel discussion ‘The Future of Leadership is Holistic – Are We Ready?’ featured JXG’s leadership members and was moderated by Dona Amelia

In a world increasingly defined by volatility and rapid change, JXG (Janashakthi Group) recognises leadership as a shared journey of growth, authenticity, and collective purpose.

In steering a bold new course for leadership, one prioritising psychological strength, authentic purpose, and human connection as the foundation for enduring success, JXG pioneered a proactive blueprint for corporate stability.

The JXG Holistic Leadership Summit 2025 which unfolded recently was designed to future-proof the business, creating a replicable model for how companies can retain top talent and drive sustainable growth in uncertain times. The unconventional leadership event was a curated journey of introspection, dialogue, and renewal, helping leaders align personal well-being with professional impact.

The inspiring convergence united senior leaders from the Group with two internationally acclaimed facilitators; Nick Jonsson, a renowned speaker and author, widely recognised for his advocacy of mental health in executive leadership, and complementing his insights was Dona Amelia, a Southeast Asian entrepreneur and empowerment coach celebrated for her transformative journey and leadership impact.

In the summit, participants explored five core dimensions of holistic leadership: surrender, purpose, connection, goals, and discipline. These themes encouraged leaders to reflect deeply on what it means to lead with intention, empathy, and steadiness in today’s complex business environment.

JXG Group Chief Human Resources Officer Wasanthi Stephen said, “At JXG, we aim to nurture leaders who uplift, empower and evolve together. In embedding psychological steadiness and authentic purpose in our leadership DNA, we are future-proofing the business, creating a model for sustainable growth and talent retention in an increasingly volatile world. Through this pioneering initiative, we are building leaders and a future-ready organisation rooted in human values and enduring capacity.”

Under the guidance of Nick and Dona, participants engaged in immersive sessions challenging traditional leadership paradigms and encouraged vulnerability, openness, and self-awareness. Through reflective exercises, storytelling, and peer dialogue, leaders were invited to explore how their personal values and emotional well-being shape their professional influence.

A highlight of the summit was the inspiring panel discussion titled ‘The Future of Leadership is Holistic – Are We Ready?’ featuring JXG’s own senior leaders. Their candid insights offered a window into how holistic practices are being integrated throughout the Group, from talent development and performance management to culture-building and strategic decision-making. The conversation strengthened JXG’s vision of leadership being a shared culture of trust, growth, and collective energy.

Throughout the summit, one message resonated clearly: when leaders nurture their emotional, mental, physical, social, and psychological well-being, they create ripple effects which can strengthen teams, build innovation, and drive long-term organisational success. Leadership then becomes more than achieving results, but about building healthier, more connected, and future-ready organisations.
