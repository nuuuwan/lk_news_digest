Bureau Veritas Lanka wins Great HR Awards 2025 for its people-centric culture

Bureau Veritas Consumer Products Services Lanka (Pvt.) Ltd, part of Bureau Veritas, has been honored with the Great HR Awards – 2025 by the Chartered Institute of Personnel Management (CIPM) Sri Lanka, marking a significant milestone in the company’s approach to employee development and workplace culture.

This is the first time Bureau Veritas CPS has received national recognition for its best-in-class people practices, acknowledging years of dedicated work in building an organization where people genuinely matter and can grow both personally and professionally.

Competing in the “Educational, Certification & Advisory Services” sector under the large category, Bureau Veritas stood out among leading industry players by demonstrating exceptional HR practices and a clear commitment to putting employees first in everything the company does. The award followed a thorough evaluation process covering 16 different assessment areas designed to measure how well organizations manage and develop their people.

Several key programs have been central to achieving this recognition. The “Adding Life to Years” Leadership Development Program focuses on building capable leaders at every level of the organization, preparing people to handle challenges and guide their teams effectively. The “HRtogether” Forum creates regular opportunities for honest conversation and problem-solving, where employees and HR work together to address real workplace issues. The “Together We Grow” initiative reflects a simple truth: when employees develop and succeed, the entire organization benefits.

Over the past several years, Bureau Veritas has worked to create a workplace where employees feel valued, heard, and supported. The company’s approach rests on three core ideas that guide all HR initiatives. Empowerment means giving people real authority to make decisions and own their work, trusting them to contribute in ways that matter.
