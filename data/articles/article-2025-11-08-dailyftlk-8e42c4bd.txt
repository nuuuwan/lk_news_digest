Correction

In Thursday’s edition of the Daily FT article titled “Top Expert Flags Overlapping Mandates, Legal Confusion in Sri Lanka’s PPP Framework” cited that the National Procurement Commission has received certain powers under Article 161 of the Constitution. It should be corrected as Article 156 of the Constitution. The error is regretted.
