Deutsche Bank marks 45 years of strategic commitment in Sri Lanka

Deutsche Bank Sri Lanka commemorates 45 years of continuous operations in the country, reaffirming its long-standing commitment to the financial ecosystem and its role as a trusted partner in economic development. Since establishing its presence in 1980, Deutsche Bank has remained the only European bank operating in Sri Lanka, offering a full suite of commercial banking services and connecting clients to Asian, European, and US markets.

Over the decades, Deutsche Bank has built deep relationships with clients across sectors, supporting trade finance, treasury, foreign exchange, and capital market access. Its consistent presence through economic cycles has positioned the bank as a reliable anchor in times of volatility and a strategic enabler during periods of growth.

In June 2025, Deutsche Bank Sri Lanka was recognised as the Best Fund Administrator – Retail Funds for the 11th consecutive year at The Asset Triple A Sustainable Investing Awards. This continued recognition underscores Deutsche Bank Sri Lanka’s market distinction as the only foreign bank in the country to offer custody, fund administration, and trustee services under a single platform. By delivering fully integrated and scalable solutions, the bank provides clients with enhanced operational efficiency and value.

In addition to this marquee win, Deutsche Bank Sri Lanka was also named Best Domestic Custodian, further cementing its position as a trusted provider with deep-rooted expertise in the local market. The bank’s broad capabilities were also acknowledged at The Asset Treasury, Trade, SSC & Risk Management Awards 2024, where it secured wins in the following categories: Best in Treasury and Working Capital (MNCs) and Best Payments and Collections Solution.
