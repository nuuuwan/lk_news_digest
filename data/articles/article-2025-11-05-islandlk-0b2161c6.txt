Uber One and Scope Cinemas team up to elevate movie-going

Uber One, the premium membership program for Uber and Uber Eats, has joined hands with Scope Cinemas, Sri Lanka’s leading cinema chain, to deliver exclusive perks for moviegoers. This partnership brings together everyday favourites – food, and films – to offer members more value and a more seamless entertainment experience..

As part of this partnership, Uber One members will enjoy an exclusive treat every month: LKR 500 off on movie tickets and LKR 500 off on food and beverages at Scope Cinemas outlets in Colombo City Centre and Havelock City. With benefits that extend beyond the app, Uber One is bringing added value to everyday moments – turning regular nights out into something special.

Varun Wijewardane, Country Manager – Delivery, Uber Sri Lanka, said, “Sri Lankans love their movies, and we love bringing people closer to the things they enjoy. With this collaboration, we’re combining convenience with a little indulgence – because a great film deserves great perks. UberOne is a smarter way not just for everyday savings on rides and deliveries but now to experience cinema too.”

UberOne membership is available at LKR 599/month or LKR 5999/year. It provides members 5% discounts on rides, free deliveries, prioritized customer support, and more. The latest partnership is part of a broader effort to make UberOne a lifestyle companion, adding value to everyday moments.
