Sri Lanka moves toward electronic invoicing with RAMIS upgrade

The Cabinet of Ministers on Monday approved engaging with Singapore-based NCS Solutions Ltd., to upgrade the Revenue Administration Management Information System (RAMIS) of the Inland Revenue Department.

The upgrade will introduce a Web API facility for VAT-registered individuals, marking a key step toward modernising tax administration.

Although Sri Lanka has not yet implemented a real-time electronic invoicing system, many countries are adopting such frameworks to enhance tax transparency, curb evasion, and streamline business transactions.

In line with these global trends, the Inland Revenue Department has evaluated the introduction of an electronic invoicing system integrated with RAMIS.

The evaluation concluded that implementing a secure Web Application Programing Interface (Web API) would serve as the initial stage of this transition, enabling VAT-registered taxpayers to interface more efficiently with the department’s digital tax systems.

This initiative aligns with broader efforts to modernise the country’s tax administration and improve compliance through technology-driven solutions.

The proposal to this effect was presented by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake in his capacity as the Finance, Planning and Economic Development Minister.
