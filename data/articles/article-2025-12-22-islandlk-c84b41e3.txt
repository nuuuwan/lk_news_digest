No evidence that babies were used as bait in colonial Sri Lanka, says leading herpetologist

Dr. Anslem de Silva debunks sensational colonial-era narratives after comprehensive review

For more than a century, sensational headlines in foreign newspapers have claimed that British sport hunters in colonial Ceylon used human babies as live bait to lure crocodiles. These chilling tales — often framed as exotic curiosities — appeared in 19th and early 20th-century American, British and Australian tabloids, complete with dramatic illustrations of infants tied to riverbanks and European hunters waiting in ambush.

But according to Sri Lanka’s foremost herpetologist and internationally acclaimed reptile expert Dr. Anslem de Silva, there is no credible historical, archaeological, sociological or biological evidence that such a practice ever took place on the island.

In a landmark paper published in the Journal of Threatened Taxa, co-authored with crocodile biologist Dr. Ruchira Somaweera, Dr. de Silva painstakingly reviewed the colonial literature, early hunting records, local oral tradition, and extensive scientific surveys. The conclusion is clear: the “baby-baiting” stories were almost certainly fabricated, exaggerated or recycled sensationalism by foreign presses.

“Not a single reliable record exists in Sri Lankan sources” — Dr. de Silva

Speaking to The Island, Dr. de Silva emphasised the striking absence of any supporting evidence from Sri Lankan history:

“Despite thousands of years of written and oral traditions involving crocodiles in Sri Lanka, not a single local source — not folklore, not hunting journals, not historical documents — mentions babies being used as bait. The only references come from sensationalist foreign newspapers, most likely self-propagated stories.”

The research team examined centuries of material, from the Mahâvamsa to detailed accounts by British, Dutch and Portuguese naturalists and hunters.

Dr. de Silva notes: “Colonial writers documented even the smallest curiosities of wildlife behaviour and hunting practices. They described using dogs, monkeys and livestock as bait — yet none mention using human infants. If such a shocking practice were real, it would undoubtedly have been recorded.”

Most references to the alleged practice originated from a cluster of foreign newspapers, between 1888 and 1911. They often reprinted — without verification — the same anecdotes, illustrations or fictionalised accounts. Some even claimed local parents “rented out babies” to English hunters.

The researchers found no record of the supposed advertisements in local newspapers, including the Ceylon Catholic Messenger, which foreign presses claimed had run a notice reading: “Babies wanted for crocodile bait — will be returned alive.”

Dr. de Silva explains: “We searched archives here and abroad. We accessed material through the Library of Congress and the National Library of Australia. No such advertisement exists. These appear to be inventions meant to entertain foreign readers with exoticised stories of the colonies.”

The study also highlights how colonial narratives often portrayed colonised societies as “primitive,” fueling racist stereotypes to justify imperial dominance.

According to Dr. de Silva: “These stories fit into a broader pattern of colonial sensationalism, where exaggeration, or fabrication, was used to depict Asian and African societies as uncivilised. Unfortunately, some of these myths still survive, online, today.”

The researchers point out that similar fabricated stories circulated about India and even the United States, where racist propaganda falsely depicted African-American children as “alligator bait” — a slur weaponised during segregation.

Historical documentation shows that while early hunters in Sri Lanka employed dogs, calves, monkeys and animal carcasses as bait, there is abundant and credible record of such practices — unlike the baby-baiting myth.

Dr. de Silva notes: “There are detailed accounts of hunters tying puppies or livestock near riverbanks to lure crocodiles. These are verified practices with multiple primary sources. But there is absolutely nothing comparable regarding human infants.”

The authors argue that debunking colonial myths is essential not only for accuracy but also for shaping a respectful understanding of Sri Lanka’s past.

Dr. de Silva adds: “Such sensationalist narratives distort our history and paint communities in an unfair light. Science must correct these misrepresentations.”

Today, Sri Lanka faces a very real human–crocodile conflict, particularly in the Nilwala, Polonnaruwa and Hambantota regions. Dr. de Silva stresses that conservation solutions require sound science and community cooperation — not myths.

“By understanding the real interactions between people and crocodiles — historically and today — we can better protect both human lives and an ancient species fighting for survival.”

The exhaustive review by Dr. Anslem de Silva and Dr. Ruchira Somaweera firmly places the “baby-baiting” stories in the realm of myth, misinformation and colonial sensationalism. Their work stands as a timely reminder of the importance of critical examination, especially when dealing with historical narratives crafted far from the lands they claim to describe.
