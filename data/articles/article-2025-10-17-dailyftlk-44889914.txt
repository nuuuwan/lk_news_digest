Port City Colombo has been named the ‘Best Knowledge Zone – Asia Pacific Region’ and received a ‘Highly Commended’ citation for Sustainable Zones in the Global Free Zones of the Year 2025 rankings by fDi Intelligence, an imprint of the Financial Times (UK).

The annual Global Free Zones of the Year awards by fDi Intelligence recognises the most promising free zones around the world—those that demonstrate exceptional potential in fostering foreign direct investment, innovation, and sustainable economic growth. Port City Colombo’s recognition underscores its growing reputation as South Asia’s premier Special Economic Zone (SEZ) and a catalyst for knowledge-based industries and investment.

CHEC Port City Colombo Managing Director Xiong Hongfeng said: “Being recognised by fDi Intelligence is a testament to the strong foundations we are building at Port City Colombo not only as a hub for international business, but also as a model for sustainable, knowledge-driven urban development in the region.”

Port City Colombo was awarded, ‘Best Knowledge Zone – Asia Pacific Region,’ based on the SEZ’s progressive regulatory framework that offers prospective investors an environment conducive towards enhancing the ease of doing business in South Asia. The judging panel specially highlighted the Colombo Port City Special Economic Zone’s assortment of fiscal and non-fiscal incentives, the International Alternative Dispute Resolution Centre that reinforces investor confidence, and the focus on driving the development of service-based sectors including IT/IT-es, professional services, maritime and logistics, and so forth.

The ‘Highly Commended’ mention for sustainability further underscores Port City Colombo’s commitment to environmentally responsible urban growth with infrastructure projects prioritising green spaces, energy efficiency, and coastal resilience.
