Germany pledges € 500,000 in emergency assistance to Sri Lanka

Under the umbrella of the European Union Civil Protection Mechanism (EU UCPM), Germany is extending emergency assistance worth approximately € 500,000 to support Sri Lanka following the devastating impact of Cyclone Ditwah.

This contribution forms part of the collective emergency response in which initial needs were identified through the EU Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (ECHO).

Financed by the German Federal Foreign Office and delivered through the Federal Agency for Technical Relief (THW), the assistance package consists of essential relief items including emergency shelter materials, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) supplies, personal and protective equipment (PPE), and technical equipment intended to support ongoing relief operations across Sri Lanka.

A delegation from the Federal Agency for Technical Relief (THW) is currently in Sri Lanka, working closely with national authorities to ensure that the assistance complements Sri Lanka’s broader relief efforts.

Germany reaffirms its solidarity with Sri Lanka in the aftermath of Cyclone Ditwah and remains committed to supporting the country’s rebuilding and recovery efforts. Germany also extends its heartfelt condolences for the tragic loss of life and the destruction caused by the cyclone.
