Sierra Cables delivers strong six-month performance for period ended 30th September 2025

Sierra Cables PLC, a subsidiary of Browns Investments (the strategic investment arm of the LOLC Group), announced a robust financial performance for the first half of the 2025/26 financial year, reflecting a period of strengthened business fundamentals, operational discipline and continued expansion across international markets.

For the six months ended 30th September 2025, the Group recorded a revenue of LKR 7.51 billion, a significant increase from LKR 4.17 billion in the corresponding period in the previous year. Gross profit rose to LKR 2.06 billion, supported by improved efficiencies and more stable raw material procurement. Profit before interest and tax reached LKR 1.66 billion, while net profit rose to LKR 1.37 billion, almost doubling year-on-year, resulting in basic earnings per share of Rs. 2.55 compared to Rs. 1.11 in the previous year.

This performance reflects Sierra Cables’ strong growth trajectory. All operational and strategic initiatives are driven by Harsha Jayatunga, Executive Director/CEO of the Company. Under his guidance, Sierra is transitioning into an export-oriented organisation with product quality aligned to global benchmarks. The Company is also proud to be Sri Lanka’s only cable manufacturer supplying UL44-certified cables for homebuilding in the US, underscoring its world-class manufacturing standards.

Commenting on the company’s performance, Harsha Jayatunga stated: “Our FY2025/26 first-half results are a strong reflection of the strategic focus and operational discipline we maintained throughout the year. The clear vision and guidance of our Chairman, Ishara Nanayakkara, continues to steer the organisation in the right direction, enabling us to execute our strategy with confidence and clarity. We achieved substantial top-line growth while strengthening gross and net profitability, despite an environment marked by fluctuating raw material costs. The affirmation of our A+ rating validates the strength of our financial position, while our expansion across global markets continues to unlock new opportunities. As we look ahead, we remain committed to deepening our global presence, enhancing manufacturing excellence and driving sustainable, long-term value creation for all stakeholders. The foundation laid in these six months gives us a strong platform for the next phase of our growth journey.”

During this period, the Company’s financial discipline was acknowledged through the continued affirmation of its A+ (lka) national long-term rating from Fitch Ratings, carrying a stable outlook.
