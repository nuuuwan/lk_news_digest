Christmas at Table by Nyne: A meal from the heart, food for the soul

At Table by Nyne, Christmas is celebrated not with excess, but with intention.

Set within the elegant and arty surrounds of Lake Lodge, the restaurant presents an understated yet indulgent way to mark the season, where thoughtful cuisine, seasonal ingredients, and timeless elegance come together in a meal that is both utterly delightful and deeply comforting.

Guests are welcomed with mulled wine and house-made raisin bread served with cranberry and pickled onion butter—a gentle nod to familiar festive flavours.

The menu moves through a series of quietly refined dishes: a daikon tart with pear and blue cheese, a smooth butternut squash soup finished with parmesan crisps, and a dark cherry sorbet that offers distinctive refreshment before the main course.

Traditional Christmas favourites are approached with restraint and balance. Turkey roulade with chicken stuffing and cranberry gravy is paired with marmalade and orange-glazed ham, while an alternative of pistachio and rosemary crusted roast lamb with mint sauce offers depth and fragrance. Seasonal accompaniments—roast potatoes, beetroot aspic, honey-glazed carrots, cauliflower gratin, and green peas—add familiar warmth and balance to the meal.

A classic Christmas pudding with brandy butter cream brings the experience to a satisfying close. The entire meal is designed as the perfect accompaniment to a Christmas day of laughter, conversation, and fond reminiscences with family and friends.
