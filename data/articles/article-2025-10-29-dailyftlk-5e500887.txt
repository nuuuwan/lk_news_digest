SAPRI shaping South Asia’s future through dialogue and action

The South Asia Policy and Research Institute (SAPRI) marked its 15th anniversary recently with a bold and timely initiative: a six-part discussion series titled “Policy Pulse: Youth Voices for South Asia.”

The second session in the series, held on 16 October at SAPRI’s Colombo 5 office, tackled the urgent theme “Gender-based violence: Breaking the silence”, drawing a full house of professionals from psychology, education, law, and media.

The event was graced by SAPRI Chairperson former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, whose presence underscored the institute’s enduring commitment to inclusive policy dialogue. The session was facilitated by renowned peace and women’s rights activist Shreen Saroor, who guided participants through a dynamic conversation and breakout workshop. Together, they crafted policy recommendations aimed at strengthening Sri Lanka’s domestic violence legislation and reforming laws affecting women, children, and marriage.

These recommendations will be refined into a policy brief—one of six to be presented to policymakers at a roundtable and conference in 2026.  SAPRI Executive Director Madara Ranmuthugala reaffirmed the institute’s mission to create meaningful spaces for public participation in national decision-making. “We are not just convening discussions,” she noted. “We are building a generation of civic thinkers who can translate dialogue into policy.”

Running until February 2026, the “Policy Pulse” series explores a range of national policy themes, each session designed to equip young Sri Lankans with the tools to engage critically and act constructively. Beyond this series, SAPRI said it continues to lead transformative projects in reconciliation and youth empowerment—including a pilot Science Education program in Mullaitivu, with plans to scale island-wide.
