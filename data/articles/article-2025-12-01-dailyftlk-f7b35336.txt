Australia commits AUD 1 m for urgent relief

Australia has announced AUD 1 million in humanitarian assistance to support Sri Lanka’s response to Cyclone Ditwah, with High Commissioner Matthew Duckworth saying Canberra “stands with Sri Lanka at this devastating time” as more than 1 million people are reported affected across all districts.

High Commissioner Duckworth said Australia will work with Government agencies, humanitarian organisations, and civil society to address urgent needs.

“Australia stands with Sri Lanka at this devastating time. The Australian Government will be providing AUD 1 million in humanitarian assistance to support Sri Lanka’s response to Cyclone Ditwah,” he said. “Our thoughts are with the people of Sri Lanka, in particular those affected by the ongoing crisis.”

The funding will be channelled through humanitarian and UN partners delivering essential services on the ground. Australia is also coordinating with civil society and non-Governmental organisation (NGO) partners to redirect existing resources towards immediate response efforts, with a focus on supporting vulnerable groups including women, girls, and persons with disabilities.

Canberra welcomed the activation of regional mechanisms, such as the Regional Prepositioning Initiative, jointly managed with the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), which will address urgent sexual and reproductive health and protection needs.
