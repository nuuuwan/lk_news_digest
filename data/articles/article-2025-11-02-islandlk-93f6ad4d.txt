Pussalla wins National Gold Award at CNCI Achiever Awards 2025

Pussalla Meat Producers (Pvt) Ltd was honoured with the National Gold Award in the Extra-Large Manufacturing Category and recognised among the Top Ten Extra-Large Companies at the CNCI Achiever Awards 2025, organized by the Ceylon National Chamber of Industries (CNCI).

As a fully vertically integrated Poultry Company in Sri Lanka, managing operations from grandparent farms to consumer retail, Pussalla continues to embody its long-term vision of self-sufficiency, uncompromised food safety, and sustainable growth.

The model also allows Pussalla to minimize dependency on external suppliers, strengthen biosecurity, and maintain stable quality across its island-wide operations.

Pussalla stood out across these criteria, demonstrating exceptional operational discipline and long-term planning. The company’s self-sufficient production model and rigorous internal quality assurance system have become benchmarks for the Sri Lankan poultry industry.

Chairman Philip J. Wewita described the CNCI recognition as “a validation of our vision, mission, and values.” Further stated that “noting that Pussalla’s success was not the result of an easy journey, but rather the outcome of unwavering commitment, dedication, and persistence demonstrated by every member of the team.”
