Economic Fallout In April: Response To UNP Deputy General Secretary Harin Fernando

“Facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored.” — Aldous Huxley

Following Cyclone Ditwah, Sri Lanka faces one of its most complex recovery challenges in recent times. Lives have been lost, livelihoods disrupted, infrastructure damaged, and communities displaced. During such moments, public discourse must focus on responsibility, accuracy, and national interest. Against this backdrop, UNP Deputy General Secretary Harin Fernando publicly declared, “Remember I said today,” on 15 December 2025, warning that Sri Lanka would face a severe economic collapse and a foreign exchange crisis by April 2026 if the fallout from Ditwah is not managed correctly. Such warnings, if grounded in facts, calculated figures, and credible evidence, deserve serious attention. However, when they are driven more by political performance than economic fundamentals, they must be critically examined.

In my earlier Colombo Telegraph article, “The Opposition Disaster Cyclone: A Threat to People, Country and Progress,” I argued that during national calamities, the Opposition, just like the government led by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, carries a moral responsibility to stand with the people and the country. Cyclone Ditwah has caused undeniable damage. Yet, converting human suffering into political alarmism risks eroding public confidence and undermining recovery efforts.

This article examines, one by one, the six warnings issued by Harin Fernando. It demonstrates why these warnings are politically dramatic but economically incomplete based on macroeconomic fundamentals and why Sri Lanka’s real challenges—and solutions—lie elsewhere.

“Sri Lanka Will Face a Major Economic Collapse by April 2026”

The central claim advanced by Harin Fernando is that Sri Lanka is heading toward a “massive economic collapse” by April 2026. This assertion fails to withstand basic macroeconomic scrutiny.

Sri Lanka’s genuine economic collapse occurred in March–April 2022. At that time, official foreign reserves had fallen to near zero, external debt obligations were unpaid, fuel and essential medicines were unavailable, and the country formally declared sovereign default. That episode represented a textbook balance-of-payments crisis driven by (i) years of fiscal mismanagement, (ii) unsustainable borrowing, and (iii) policy paralysis.

The present situation is fundamentally different. Sri Lanka today operates under:

A severe natural disaster, even one as destructive as Ditwah, does not automatically trigger a sovereign foreign exchange collapse—particularly when (i) reserves are no longer at rock bottom and (ii) capital outflows are regulated. To suggest otherwise is to ignore the basic sequencing of macroeconomic crises.

Economic collapses are not predicted by dates on a calendar. They emerge from identifiable stress indicators—none of which presently justify claims of an imminent April 2026 implosion.

The allegation that the government and the President lack a clear plan is demonstrably inaccurate.

The post-Ditwah response has been structured across three distinct time horizons, reflecting lessons painfully learned from past disasters.

* Livelihood restoration for farmers, small businesses, and informal workers

* Repair of irrigation systems, rural access roads, and local markets

* The establishment of the “Sri Lanka Rebuilding Fund” is proper throughout

Unlike previous governments that prioritized rapid reconstruction for political optics, the current administration is emphasizing (i) people-centred,  (ii) risk-informed recovery. That approach may be slower, but it is economically and socially sound.

Harin Fernando’s assertion that no credible damage assessment exists disregards ongoing institutional processes.

Preliminary estimates place the damage caused by Cyclone Ditwa at approximately USD 5–6 billion. These figures are necessarily provisional. More importantly:

* A World Bank–led Post-Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA) is currently underway

* This process ensures accuracy, prioritization, and donor confidence and support via the proposed donor conference.

Sri Lanka’s experience shows that rushed assessments often lead to white-elephant projects, inflated contracts, and fiscal leakage. A methodical evaluation is not a failure of governance; it is a correction of past mistakes.

This warning reflects a misunderstanding of Sri Lanka’s post-crisis economic structure.

While agriculture has suffered losses, the majority of recovery and reconstruction inputs are domestically sourced:

Export agriculture supply routes have already been restored, ensuring continuity in tea, rubber, coconut, and other export earnings. Food import dependency has not surged to levels that would destabilize the balance of payments.

Disaster recovery in Sri Lanka historically places greater pressure on the fiscal account than on the foreign exchange account. There is no automatic spike in dollar demand sufficient to justify alarmist predictions.

A foreign exchange crisis emerges when external obligations exceed available FX inflows, leading to reserve depletion and payment arrears. That is not the current situation.

* Contributions by Diaspora . This is increasing along US$ billions

Crucially, most Ditwah-related recovery expenditure will be rupee-denominated, not dollar-based. While fiscal space remains constrained, existing buffers are positioned to absorb the shock.

Equating Ditwah with the 2022 collapse confuses natural disaster recovery with systemic macroeconomic failure.

“External Political Actors Should Be Brought In to Manage the Crisis”

Fernando’s call to involve external political figures—including Ranil Wickremesinghe—reveals more political nostalgia than economic reasoning.

* Structural vulnerabilities deepened over three decades of UNP dominance

That the UNP now relies on Harin Fernando—a spokesperson with limited demonstrated engagement in macroeconomic analysis—to issue dire economic warnings highlights the party’s intellectual decline.

Crisis governance requires institutional competence, evidence-based policy, and accountability—not recycled political leadership associated with past failures.

Cyclone Ditwah does not drive recent pressures on the USD/LKR exchange rate.

* Motor vehicle imports exceeding the soft allocation of USD 1–1.2 billion

* Commencement of external debt repayments under imperfect ISB restructuring arrangements

These are policy-choice issues stemming from earlier decisions, not shocks caused by disasters.

Cyclone Ditwa must serve as a national wake-up call. The question is not merely how quickly to rebuild, but where and how.

Relocating displaced communities back to geologically unstable areas would risk lives and waste public funds. Scientifically informed relocation—though time-consuming—is the only sustainable option. Identifying suitable land while minimizing livelihood disruption requires patience and public support.

Similarly, infrastructure rebuilding must be preceded by proper feasibility studies. Sri Lanka’s poor record in this area under previous governments directly contributed to the 2022 crisis. The present administration is obligated to break that cycle.

Contrary to alarmist claims, Sri Lanka possesses substantial domestic capacity for recovery:

* restored transport connectivity between the up-country and the lowlands

Exports remain intact, food imports are manageable, and remittances continue to rise. Tourism may experience a short-term dip, but long-term prospects remain unchanged.

In addition, diplomatic support from friendly nations and multilateral partners will help shoulder part of the recovery burden.

Is a foreign exchange crisis around the corner because of Cyclone Ditwah? Based on available evidence, the answer is no.

Ditwah is a human tragedy and a development challenge—but not a trigger for an imminent macroeconomic collapse. Recovery requires scientific planning, fiscal discipline, and national unity.

Manufacturing panic may serve short-term political agendas, but it undermines confidence and weakens recovery. Sri Lanka has already paid a heavy price for such irresponsibility.

What the country needs now is not “Remember I said today” rhetoric—but remembering the hard lessons of 2022 and refusing to repeat them.
