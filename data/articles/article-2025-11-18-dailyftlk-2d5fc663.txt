Panasian Power connects sixth 5MW solar plant  to national grid

Panasian Power PLC (PAP) has connected its latest 5MW ground-mounted solar project at Uda Aparakke to the national grid, marking another step in its build-out of utility-scale renewable capacity.

The company said the facility was successfully linked to the Matara Grid Substation yesterday, triggering the start of commercial revenue. It is the sixth 5MW ground-mounted plant delivered under the seven power-purchase agreements PAP signed in the third quarter of 2024. One remaining project is still under development.

The Uda Aparakke plant adds 5MWac, equivalent to 6.76MWp of installed DC capacity, to Sri Lanka’s grid. PAP said the commissioning is a “significant milestone” in its expansion strategy as the company accelerates its pipeline of solar assets following policy reforms aimed at increasing renewable-energy penetration.

The project incorporates Longi bi-facial N-type 615W modules mounted on a fixed-tilt system. According to PAP, the design uses enhanced DC sizing to optimise output and maintain an efficient AC/DC ratio under Sri Lankan conditions.

The plant is operated by a PAP subsidiary and begins contributing to earnings immediately. The company said its rollout of ground-mounted projects continues in line with its strategy to scale clean-energy generation while integrating more advanced technology where commercially viable.
