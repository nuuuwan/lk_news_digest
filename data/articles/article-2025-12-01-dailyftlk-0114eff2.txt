India intensifies support to Sri Lanka under Operation Sagar Bandhu

India has further scaled up its humanitarian assistance to Sri Lanka under ‘Operation Sagar Bandhu,’ as the island continues to face severe flooding, landslides, and widespread devastation in the aftermath of Cyclone Ditwah.

With essential infrastructure disrupted and thousands affected, additional relief and rescue assets have been deployed to strengthen ongoing efforts across the country.

Earlier this morning, two Indian Air Force (IAF) aircraft, a C-130J and an IL-76, arrived with approximately 21 tons of relief supplies, along with 80 personnel from the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF). These highly trained rescue teams have already been deployed to Puttalam and Badulla, two of the worst-affected regions.

Two Chetak helicopters from INS Vikrant with Sri Lankan Air Force personnel onboard joined Search and Rescue (SAR) operations. The helicopters have completed four sorties, rescuing stranded civilians and transporting them to safety. Further, two MI-17V5 helicopters of the IAF arrived in Sri Lanka, with essential Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) supplies and personnel, in the evening to bolster ongoing SAR efforts.

The relief consignments handed over yesterday include essential items such as emergency shelter supplies, personal and hygiene essentials and lighting and safety support. The relief materials were formally handed over to the Government of Sri Lanka by Acting High Commissioner Dr. Satyanjal Pandey.

As Sri Lanka continues to grapple with widespread flooding and displacement, India remains committed to working closely with Sri Lankan authorities to support ongoing rescue, relief, and recovery efforts.

Operation Sagar Bandhu continues in full swing, with more assistance on the way.
