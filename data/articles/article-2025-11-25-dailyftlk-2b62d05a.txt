Sri Lanka has asked Canada to curb activities on Canadian soil that endorse separatist narratives tied to Sri Lanka, including the public display of LTTE symbols.

Foreign Minister Vijitha Herath made the request during a meeting with Canadian High Commissioner Isabelle Catherine Martin.

Herath said groups in Canada continue to organise events and campaigns that attempt to revive separatist sentiment, adding that such efforts undermine Sri Lanka’s attempts to strengthen reconciliation and community relations. He asked that these concerns be communicated to Ottawa, warning that unchecked activism of this kind risks creating misunderstandings between the two countries.

High Commissioner Martin reiterated that the LTTE remains listed as a terrorist organisation in Canada and that the Canadian government does not recognise LTTE symbols or related imagery. She also affirmed Canada’s support for Sri Lanka’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.
