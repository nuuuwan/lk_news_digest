Starlink offers free connectivity in Sri Lanka after Cyclone Ditwah

Starlink has announced that it is providing free satellite internet service in Sri Lanka for those affected by Cyclone Ditwah and subsequent flooding, extending support to both new and existing users until the end of December 2025.

The company said it is working closely with the Government to deliver additional assistance as restoration efforts continue across several districts.

In a statement, Starlink said free service credits are being automatically applied to active users in the impacted areas, requiring no action from customers. Suspended or paused accounts are also being credited, allowing affected users to reactivate their service for the duration of the support period.

“For those affected by the severe flooding in Indonesia and Sri Lanka in the aftermath of Cyclone Ditwah, Starlink is providing free service to new and existing customers through the end of December 2025. We’re also working with the Indonesian Government to rapidly deploy terminals and restore connectivity to the hardest-hit areas on Sumatra, as well as with the Sri Lankan Government to provide additional assistance,” the company said.

Starlink also extended the offer to new customers in the affected regions. After purchasing and activating a terminal, users are advised to create a support ticket referencing “Sri Lanka Flood Support” to receive the free service period.

The company said its focus is on ensuring impacted communities maintain access to reliable connectivity while recovery operations are underway.

The authorised agent for Starlink in Sri Lanka is Singer (Sri Lanka) PLC.
