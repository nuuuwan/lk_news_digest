No-IMF path would have been ‘twice as painful’ for Sri Lanka, says Dr. Ahluwalia

In a compelling address that offered a fresh perspective on Sri Lanka’s ongoing economic recovery, eminent Indian economist Dr. Montek Singh Ahluwalia argued that the alternative to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme would have demanded reforms ‘twice as painful’ for the Sri Lankan people.

Dr. Ahluwalia, a key architect of India’s economic liberalisation, was delivering the keynote speech at a public forum organised by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka on October 10.

His remarks provided a powerful counter-narrative to the prevalent criticism that the IMF’s conditions are the primary source of public hardship.

He explained that had Sri Lanka opted to forgo an agreement with the IMF, the country would have faced the monumental task of creating its own economic programme to restore international confidence.

“To be credible, such a homegrown plan would have necessitated even more severe and drastic policy measures than those currently being implemented under the IMF’s Extended Fund Facility (EFF),” he said.

“If Sri Lanka hadn’t entered into an agreement with the IMF, it would have had to present its own economic programme to restore confidence,” Dr. Ahluwalia stated. “That would require twice as much painful economic reforms and policies than what the IMF has asked for, leading to more painful consequences for the people,” he noted.

Dr. Ahluwalia highlighted that the IMF’s involvement is not merely about financial assistance; it serves as a crucial ‘seal of approval’ to the global community.

“With the entry of the IMF, Sri Lanka could tell the world that the country is operating in line with proper economic principles under its guidance,” he noted.

“This signal is vital for reassuring investors, creditors, and international markets, thereby buying the nation valuable time to stabilise its economy and navigate the complex process of debt restructuring,” he pointed out.

This perspective directly challenges the narrative from some political quarters that have consistently criticised the last administration headed by former president Ranil Wickremesinghe for adhering to the IMF’s benchmarks, often blaming the programme for the economic strain faced by citizens. Dr. Ahluwalia’s analysis suggests that while the current path is difficult, the alternative would have been significantly harsher.

Addressing the future of Sri Lanka’s engagement with the Fund, Dr. Ahluwalia cautioned against a premature exit from the programme. He stressed that any decision to withdraw must be based on solid economic fundamentals, not political expediency.

He advised that Sri Lanka should only consider concluding the IMF programme when its economy demonstrates robust health and a proven resilience to both internal and external shocks, supported by strong economic indices.

“Until the corrective measures are in place, you shouldn’t do so,” he warned.

“When they are in place and you are resilient… you can tell the IMF, ‘Okay, thank you, we don’t need your support anymore. If the need arises, we will let you know,’ and wrap up the IMF programme.”

His speech provided a vital, and until now unheard, perspective for the Sri Lankan public and policymakers, reframing the painful but necessary reforms as the less severe of two difficult paths toward sustainable economic recovery.
