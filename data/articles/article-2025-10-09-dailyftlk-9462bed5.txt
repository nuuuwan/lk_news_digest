State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) under the Industries and Enterprise Development Ministry — Lanka Mineral Sands, BCC Lanka Ltd., National Salt Company, Lanka Phosphate Company, and Lanka Graphite Ltd., — have handed over a portion of their dividends earned under the new Government to the Treasury.

The funds were officially presented to Labour Minister and Economic Development Deputy Minister Dr. Anil Jayantha Fernando and Treasury Secretary Dr. Harshana Suriyapperuma.

Lanka Mineral Sands Acting Chairman Gayan Wellala contributed Rs. 500 million from dividends earned over the past nine months to the Treasury. He stated that the institution aims to achieve a revenue target of Rs. 5 billion by the end of this year.

BCC Lanka Chairman H.A. Prasanna Indrajith handed over Rs. 50 million to the Treasury as part of the company’s dividends. Notably, BCC Lanka had previously been a loss-making enterprise that was slated for closure. The company has now accumulated fixed deposits worth Rs. 105 million during the current year.

National Salt Company Chairman Gayan Wellala contributed Rs. 100 million in dividends to the Treasury. Despite challenges faced earlier this year due to a nationwide salt shortage, the company has recovered strongly over the past six months. The Chairman expressed confidence that the company would record the highest production revenue in its history by the end of the year.

Lanka Phosphate Company Chairman Ananda Premakumara, who was also present, announced that Rs. 100 million will be remitted to the Treasury next week, while the remaining dividends will be reinvested for the company’s development.
