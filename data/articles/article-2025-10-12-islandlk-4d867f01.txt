First Sri Lankan restaurant ‘Cinnara’ opens in Beijing

For the thousands of Sri Lankans living in China and for Chinese travellers who have grown to love the island’s cuisine, a long-awaited dining option has finally arrived. “Cinnara,” the first-ever Sri Lankan restaurant in China, officially opened its doors in Beijing this month.

Founded by Chiranjaya Udumullage, a Sri Lankan entrepreneur who pursued his higher education in China, the restaurant is the realization of a dream born during his student days. He noticed a significant gap: there was no place to find authentic Sri Lankan flavours, leaving both expatriates and returning Chinese tourists without a taste of the island.

“The inspiration for ‘Cinnara’ emerged during my student years,” Udumullage shared. He was motivated to bridge this culinary gap, dedicating nearly a decade to studying global culinary practices and preparing to introduce the true essence of Sri Lankan cuisine to Beijing.

Located in the Chaoyang District, Cinnara is more than just a restaurant; it aims to be a cultural bridge between the two nations.

Leading the kitchen is Head Chef Nishad Samaranayake, a seasoned culinary professional backed by a team of skilled Sri Lankan chefs, ensuring the authenticity of every dish.

The restaurant operates daily from 11:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m., welcoming over 4,000 Sri Lankan students and professionals in China, as well as all food enthusiasts, to experience the diverse flavours of Sri Lanka. With plans to expand to other major Chinese cities, Cinnara is poised to become a cornerstone for Sri Lankan culture and a new, exciting dimension to Beijing’s renowned dining scene.
