Govt. to address challenges in releasing military-held lands in Jaffna-Palaly area

The Government has reaffirmed its commitment to resolve land issues in a transparent manner by releasing private lands within the Jaffna-Palaly area to their rightful owners.

This was highlighted by Deputy Minister Maj. Gen. (Retd.) Aruna Jayasekara at a meeting convened at his office in Colombo to review the progress and address ongoing challenges related to the release of private lands situated within the Jaffna-Palali area to their rightful owners.

Discussions were focused on resolving operational and administrative hurdles, particularly reviewing the military’s phased withdrawal to expedite the handover of remaining private lands, the Defence Ministry said in a statement.

The deliberations also covered the finalisation of new boundary alignments aimed at minimising the impact on civilian properties while ensuring the continued protection of essential defence installations.

At the meeting, both Deputy Minister Jayasekara and Defence Secretary Air Vice Marshal (Retd.) Sampath Thuyacontha reaffirmed the Government’s unwavering commitment to resolving land-related issues as a vital component of national reconciliation.

They emphasised that the process must remain transparent, equitable, and fully aligned with national security considerations. (SS)
