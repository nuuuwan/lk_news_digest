Governance Matters: SEC engages corporate leaders

Addressing the critical issue of disclosure requirements for director resignations, Basnayake provided clarity on the timing and compliance obligations under the Listing Rules and Companies Act.

“The Listing Rules are pretty clear. You need to make an immediate disclosure market announcement of a resignation of a director. So it all boils down to the effective date of the resignation,” he explained.

He detailed the legal framework governing resignation timing: “Section 207 of the Companies Act says a director can resign by issuing a letter of resignation to the registered office of the company, and the resignation becomes effective on the receipt by the company of the resignation letter, or if the letter specifies a later date, on that later date.”

Addressing the complex interplay between recent amendments to Section 211 of the Companies Act and the Listing Rules regarding director independence, Wijayawardhane clarified the stricter requirements for maintaining independence status beyond age 70.

“That’s an interesting scenario. The new Companies Act amendments have clarified the position with regard to the continuation of a director who is more than 70. But that’s a statutory provision. Our rules are related to the independence of the person. So the rule still remains, if you’re over 70, you are not independent,” Wijayawardhane stated.

Ms. L. K. Sunethra Dharmakeerthi, Registrar of Companies, provided comprehensive guidance on the practical implementation of beneficial ownership provisions under the Companies Act No. 12 of 2025, emphasizing the critical timelines and obligations for listed companies.

She outlined the specific requirements for existing companies: “Under Section 130H, you have to disclose the information of the ultimate beneficial owners of existing companies within six months from the date of operation of the new Companies Act. However, if it is a company listed on the stock exchange, you have to share the ultimate beneficial owner information through the CSE to the Registrar of Companies not within six months, but within 30 days from the date of operation.”

The session provided directors with practical insights into their responsibilities and the evolving regulatory landscape. The dialogue underscored the SEC’s commitment to working collaboratively with market participants to strengthen corporate governance standards and enhance investor confidence in Sri Lanka’s capital market.
