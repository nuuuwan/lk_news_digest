Viet Nam trade delegation signals timely investment momentum  for SL’s post-cyclone recovery

Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade of Viet Nam Phan Thi Thang

The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce and the Embassy of Viet Nam in Sri Lanka co-organised the Viet Nam–Sri Lanka Business Forum on 9 December, in conjunction with the 3rd Viet Nam–Sri Lanka Subcommittee on Trade co-chaired by Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade of Viet Nam Phan Thi Thang and Secretary of the Ministry of Trade, Commerce, Food Security and Co-operative Development of Sri Lanka, K.A. Vimalenthirarajah.

The event drew strong participation from across the local business community. The forum brought together a high-profile visiting Vietnamese delegation led by Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade Phan Thi Thang, alongside Ambassador Trinh Thi Tam, comprising several high-profile representatives from Viet Nam’s Ministry of Trade, Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as well as leading corporate entities in agricultural machinery, aquaculture, aviation, and pharmaceuticals.

The delegation’s arrival, coordinated in close partnership with the Embassy of Viet Nam in Sri Lanka, came at an especially important time. As the country works to rebuild economic momentum in the aftermath of Cyclone Ditwah, international trade delegations help reinforce confidence, renew investor interest, and signal clearly that Sri Lanka remains open for business.

Ambassador Trinh Thi Tam has played a steady and constructive role in strengthening engagement, and the strong turnout at the forum reflected that sustained effort.

Coffee emerged as an unexpected highlight of the discussions. While Viet Nam is known the world over for its coffee industry, the delegation noted that Sri Lanka’s climate and soil conditions make it an ideal location for cultivation, and expressed interest in facilitating potential investment in coffee plantations in Sri Lanka from Vietnamese companies as well as sharing expertise. The delegation also expressed interest in opportunities across agriculture and aquaculture, logistics, textiles and garments, machinery, broader trade and investment, and early direct flights.

The Ceylon Chamber said itis committed to carrying this progress forward and advancing deeper commercial engagement between the two countries.
