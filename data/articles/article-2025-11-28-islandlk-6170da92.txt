Ceylinco Life ignites team spirit at 2025 Sports Festival

Ceylinco Life’s Sports Festival 2025 brought a burst of colour and competitive energy to the Torrington Grounds recently, as around 1,200 participants from all major business groups, the Head Office and the senior management turned out for the Company’s biggest sporting day of the year.

This year’s festival not only reflected Ceylinco Life’s commitment to employee health and well-being but also brought together colleagues from across generations, with participants aged 20 to 65, highlighting a culture of inclusivity and unity, the Company said.

A full slate of track and field events, from the 100m dash to the 1,500m, along with long jump, high jump, shot put and discus, kept the grounds buzzing, with the walking race and a spirited tug of war adding extra edge to the programme.

This year’s festival built on group events held in September, which featured cricket, badminton, netball and volleyball matches that set the tone for the final showdown. When the points were tallied, the PK Group clinched overall honours, while the NS/KS Group secured the Runner-up title.

For many, the highlight was seeing employees from different departments and backgrounds form friendships and support one another, as described by one participant: “The festival allowed us to bond beyond our regular work roles. Cheering each other on made us feel like one big family.”

Individual performances also stood out. W. D. V. Kavinda of the ST Group was crowned Best Male Athlete, and Ms A. D. Sagarika of the TV Group took the title of Best Female Athlete, rounding off a day that celebrated teamwork, talent and sporting passion across the Company.

The event highlighted Ceylinco Life’s commitment to collaboration, excellence, and employee well-being, bringing together staff from all levels to strengthen the Company’s shared vision. The Sports Festival continues to inspire a positive culture and reinforces Ceylinco Life’s dedication to supporting its employees and agency force, the President of the Company’s Sports Club Chamath Alwis said.

“At Ceylinco Life, we believe that promoting health and well-being among our employees is fundamental to our mission. The Sports Festival is a wonderful opportunity for us to come together, celebrate achievements, and reinforce our commitment to excellence and employee engagement,” he added.
