Gypsies create a night to remember …

Yes, it certainly turned out to be an electrifying night with Sri Lanka’s most beloved band, Gypsies, performing live at the Centre Concord, in San Francisco, California.

It all happened on Friday, 17th October, 2025, and doing the needful for readers of The Island is the now famous Mahesha Manjuka Warusawitharana who checked out the UB40 concert in San Francisco, on 26th September, 2025, and shared her excitement with our readers.

The ‘Dance with Gypsies’ concert, in San Francisco, was an unforgettable musical celebration that brought the vibrant spirit of Sri Lanka to California, says Mahesha, adding that the event was impeccably organised by Lucky Ace Productions.

Before arriving in San Francisco, the Gypsies had already thrilled audiences in Chicago, New York, and Texas, making the Bay Area stop one of the highlights of their US tour.

After the San Francisco performance, they continued on to Los Angeles before flying back to Sri Lanka, concluding a truly successful series of shows that drew enthusiastic crowds eager to experience the legendary band’s energy and charm.

From the moment the band took the stage, at the Centre Concord, the atmosphere was electrifying, with Piyal, Shenal, and the rest of the Gypsies, delivering an exceptional performance, keeping the audience dancing and singing late into the night.

Their setlist featured many fan favourites, including  ‘Pitikotapan None,’ ‘Sumihiri Pane,’ ‘Lunu Dehi,’ ‘Thatha Mata Anapu Tokka,’ ‘Kurumitto’ and ‘Amathakakaranna Epa,’ and the crowd couldn’t resist joining in during the energetic baila numbers that have made the Gypsies household names for decades.

Heartfelt memories to cherish for Mahesha (right) and her cousin

Says Mahesha: “A particularly memorable moment came when the band performed ‘Dias Ge Nangi,’ as my cousin took to the dance floor and captivated everyone with her graceful moves.”

The concert began around 7:30 p.m. and continued until midnight, with fans enjoying refreshing drinks and an array of authentic Sri Lankan cuisine at the venue—adding a true taste of home to the experience.

The evening evoked deep nostalgia and pride among the Sri Lankan audience.

The warmth of the band’s interaction with fans was another highlight; after the show, Piyal personally came to the lobby, chatted with attendees, and posed for photos, leaving everyone with heartfelt memories to cherish.

Mahesha went on to say that the ‘Dance with Gypsies’ concert was more than just a performance – “it was a joyful reunion with culture, rhythm, and community and for those who attended, it will be remembered as one of the most spirited and emotional nights of the year.”
