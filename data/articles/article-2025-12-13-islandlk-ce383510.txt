“When Justice Steps In: The Supreme Court Breaks the Cycle of Ragging Impunity”

The Supreme Court (SC) intervention in granting leave to proceed with two fundamental petitions under case no SC/FR/101/2025 – filed over the tragic ragging that resulted in the death of Charith Dilshan Dushantha, a second year student of Sabaragamuwa University of Sri Lanka (SUSL) and the ten interim orders imposed a damning indictment on the authorities who have allegedly failed to enforce anti-ragging laws and administrative guidelines.

The SC held that the two petitioners, namely Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) and the parents of the victim had established a prima-facie case suggesting a possible violation of Article 12(1) of the Constitution, which guarantees equal protection of the law.

What is to be emphasized here is not only the granting of leave but the severity of interim orders served on the 69 respondents until the final determination of the case calling for documentary evidence on the prerogative actions taken within the confines of the law assigned to them by the statutes. The two petitioners contend that the tragedy was not an isolated failure but the result of systematic negligence by university authorities, University Grant Commission (UGC), Vice Chancellors of the Universities, law enforcement officials and other relevant institutions.

For thousands of students, gaining admission to a university is a moment of triumph – the result of years of hard work and perseverance sleepless nights, steadfast pursuit. They enter these seats of higher learnings with dreams of knowledge, growth and a future filled with promise and assurance. But the hard reality of the fact is these dreams had been mercilessly and brutally shattered by a handful of misguided youth, well-knowing the lackadaisical attitude and inaction by the authorities over the decades.

Before dealing with the far-reaching initiatives and healthy signals contained in the interim orders, it may be opportune to appraise the readers of the remedial measures initiated by the government with a view to eradicating ragging menace from the Universities. A noteworthy legislative enactment was promulgated as far back as 1998 – Prohibition of Ragging another Forms of Violence in Educational Institutions Act No 20 of 1998 criminalizing the ragging within the university premises. But what was alarming was not only the freshers but also the seniors have been subjected to harassment and abuse in the name of ragging after the law came in to effect, resulting over the anxiety, depression, post-traumatic disorders. Some have never returned to their studies, denying of the future they once envisioned.

It should be explicitly placed on record that the persistence of ragging in Sri Lankan Universities manifestly signals a distinct failure of enforcement, awareness and institutional accountability. Universities have a moral obligation to protect students, yet many authorities have continued a blind eye, allowing this barbarian culture to persist. Administrative bodies have often failed to investigate complaints properly leaving victims without justice and indirectly supporting perpetrators.

The aforesaid anti-ragging Act empowers the Universities to adopt a zero-tolerance conducive environment allowing the students to concentrate on studies free from harassments, bullying and other forms of intimidations. Many students remain unaware of their rights and legal protections. Universities must conduct awareness programs that educate students about ragging, its dangers, the support and systems, legal remedies recourse to them. Counselling systems and safe reporting mechanisms must be strengthened.

Contrary what has happened is that the perpetrators have taken the ragging culture outside the university premises after the promulgation of the law. A case in point was the brutally assault on an anti-ragging student at his private boarding house by 20 students of the Faculty of Technology of the Sri Jayawardanapura University for opposing the ragging culture on the 29th April 2025. The people are not aware whether the University Administration or the long arm of the law moved quickly and dealt with these criminals.

Sri Lankan Universities should be places of learning, innovation, research and development and personal growth free from intimidations. The eternal hope with which students enter university must be protected and safeguarded by the authorities. It appears that the SC has taken cognizance these facts as a whole and issued interim orders, which would pave a detrimental effect not only the violent students and backed by their student councils but also on the weak-kneed officers and authorities. It must be stated here that ending ragging is not just about enforcing laws alone. A much-broader multifaceted issue transforming mindsets authorities, students, law enforcement agencies and all the stakeholders. It is earnest believed that the SC intervention could go a long way in transforming this mindset

It shall be the bounden duty of the stakeholders to create an awareness for the students about the legal protection available to them prior to the commencement of the academic sessions in the universities. Such an awareness program would be extremely helpful for the students, under graduates, parents of the students. I am glad that Gaveshi Foundation of Gampaha has taken the bold initiative of taking this message for the benefit of the students who are qualified to enter universities. Similarly, it is time for the Companies to conduct similar programs under their CSR projects.

This article would be incomplete that the incidents of ragging which resulted in the death of under-graduates is not highlighted after the promulgation of the law – Prohibition of Ragging other Forms of Violence in Educational Institutions Act No 20 of 1998. (See Tabel)

The need of the hour is to instil the discipline at every layer of the universities without belittling the decency of this golden rule and to establish a violent free environment and the UGC and the relevant officials should have the courage and the will to bell the cat by taking the maximum support of the legal mechanisms afforded to them by the enactments.

Now that SC has displayed a legalistic intervention with the sole objective of eradicating this ragging menace, a multifaceted approach should be vigorously persuaded to instil a ragging free culture in the universities. Such programs include educational reforms, psychological support and counselling to both victims and raggers, policy enforcement to implement anti-ragging laws and punish the culprits, criminalize ragging, expose and depoliticize student unions, banning of raggers from public employment and university academic positions and the create more open space for whistleblowers .

Ragging and Loss of life from the viewpoint of Senior Academic

From the viewpoint of Professor O.A. IIeperuma, an eminent senior academic says in an article published that inhuman ragging goes unabated due to the fault of the universities. Vice Chancellors are mortally scared of these violent student groups backed by their unions to taken punitive action against the perpetrators of violence. Vice Chancellors tend to paint a picture of a peaceful atmosphere in the universities to show their political masters. Vice Chancellors are also aware of instances where strong action taken against ragging by the Vice Chancellors have resulted in their removal such as Prof. Epitawatta at Sri Jayawardnapura University and Professor Sujeewa Amarasena at the Ruhuna University.

Vice Chancellors desist from taking action against raggers because of their fear that the student will organize protests and even resort to physical violence against them. Academic staff also turn blind eye even when see instances where ragging is openly carried out by the seniors.

This may be because they themselves were raggers in the past and see nothing harmful in such sordid instances of ragging. Prof. Ileperuma says that unlike in the past ragging today is inhuman, violating privacy and forcing helpless undergraduates in the worst forms of human torture.

Ragging is most violent in halls of residence where the wardens and sub wardens simply turn the other way and never try to stop this menace. According to Prof. Ileperuma Police are to be blamed for not taking action against ragging under the Anti-Ragging Act. Sometime ago, Police is reported have stated that all forms of ragging should be reported to the CID but nothing happened under this arrangement. Similarly, Attorney General is reported to have given an undertaking to the Supreme Court that the Vice Chancellors have been instructed to prevent ragging in the universities. And since then nothing substantial has come out.

Similarly, the Attorney General’s Department takes years to prosecute raggers who have been caught red-handed, produced before the judges and release the raggers on bail. Professsor Ileperuma contends that political parties who back the student unions cry themselves hoarse for preserving free education but they do not have the slightest idea that these ragging incidents are a big threat to free education. It must be said with profound salute to the SC that the interim injections have penetrated in to all these vital factors with a view to eradicating this ragging culture.

Sri Lanka now stands at a decisive crossroads where the culture of fear, silence and institutional paralysis that enabled ragging for decades can no longer be tolerated or excused. The Supreme Court’s bold intervention has, for the first time in recent memory, pierced through the bureaucratic lethargy that allowed this cruelty to flourish unchecked. By demanding accountability from every layer of authority—university administrators, law-enforcement agencies, regulatory bodies and political overseers—the Court has reaffirmed that the lives and dignity of students are not bargaining chips in a system long compromised by inaction, indifference and political patronage. This judicial awakening signals to the nation that the protection of young scholars is not optional but a constitutional duty.

It is now incumbent upon the stakeholders to transform this legal momentum into lasting cultural reform: to dismantle impunity, empower victims, expose perpetrators, and cultivate universities where learning—not intimidation—defines the student experience. If the Supreme Court’s intervention becomes the catalyst that finally compels institutions to act with courage, integrity and moral responsibility, then the tragic death of Charith Dilshan will not be another statistic, but a turning point in restoring humanity, discipline and safety to Sri Lanka’s seats of higher learning.

One could obviously foresee the severity of the signals by way of interim orders displayed by the SC on the 69 respondents of the above FR case. Its final determination will be a sure-fire beneficial landmark judgment for all of us to reap the full benefits of the free education hitherto we have not enjoyed.
