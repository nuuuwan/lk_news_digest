Harini says SL opposes international human rights probe, backs domestic mechanism

Prime Minister Harini Amarasuriya yesterday told Parliament that the Government has informed the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) of its opposition to establishing an international mechanism to address human rights violations.

She said such mechanisms tend to deepen divisions among communities in Sri Lanka. However, the Government has conveyed its commitment to setting up a domestic process to deal with human rights concerns.

“The Government will work with international organisations while focusing on a domestic mechanism to deal with human rights violations,” the Prime Minister said.
