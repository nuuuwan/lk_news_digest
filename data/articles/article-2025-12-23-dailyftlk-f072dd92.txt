Elephant House Ice Cream  marks historic launch in Australia

Ceylon Cold Stores PLC (CCS), a subsidiary of John Keells Holdings PLC, has launched its iconic Elephant House Ice Cream in Australia, marking a bold step in the brand’s global expansion.

The official unveiling took place on 4 December 2025 at the Novotel Melbourne Glen Waverley, where industry leaders, local distributors, and strategic partners gathered to celebrate the occasion. The launch was further honoured by the presence of Consul General Designate of Sri Lanka Pradeepa Seram and Member of the Australian Parliament Cassandra Fernando, reflecting the deep and growing connections between Sri Lanka and Australia.

Elephant House is one of the highest-penetrated Sri Lankan brands among Sri Lankan communities living overseas, with a presence in 16 countries, including the Maldives, Australia, and the United Kingdom, among others.

In a significant milestone for the company, Elephant House Ice Cream is now manufactured locally in Melbourne to support wider availability in the ethnic market in Australia. The range currently available includes Vanilla, Karutha Kolomban, and Fruit and Nut in 500ml packs.

This marks the first time in CCS’s 150-year legacy that Elephant House Ice Cream has been produced outside Sri Lanka, signalling a new chapter in the company’s international growth journey in collaboration with Millennium Imports Pty Ltd, one of the franchise partners for Australia.

John Keells Consumer Foods Sector President Daminda Gamlath said: “We are thrilled to introduce Elephant House Ice Cream to the Australian market. This launch represents more than expansion it’s about taking a brand that Sri Lankans trust and love, and making it available to wider communities abroad, with the right partners and the right long-term ambition.”

Ceylon Cold Stores PLC Category Head – Confectionery and Business Head – Exports Sathish Rathnayake said: “Elephant House has already earned a strong following internationally, and Australia is a natural next step given the strength of our broader export presence here. This launch is a strategic move to grow availability, build familiarity beyond the Sri Lankan community, and expand the range over time to meet evolving consumer preferences.”

Ceylon Cold Stores PLC International Marketing Head Sudantha Victoria said: “This is a proud milestone for CCS and for Elephant House. Producing ice cream outside Sri Lanka for the first time is a major operational and brand achievement, made possible through collaboration with our partners in Australia. Our focus now is on expanding distribution across the country and introducing new flavours and formats that will help Elephant House become a preferred choice in the market.”

With its flagship range now available, CCS plans to expand availability across Australia and progressively introduce other popular flavours and formats, reinforcing Elephant House’s position as a globally recognised Sri Lankan brand with enduring appeal.
