Corporal punishment in schools

The proposed amendment to the Penal Code banning corporal punishment in schools, introduced by the Government, has generated considerable public interest. Dr. Harini Amarasuriya, the Prime Minister and Minister of Education, Higher Education, and Vocational Training, has clarified that the proposed law forms part of a broader reform to protect all children across society, and is not intended to target teachers or schools.

These legal reforms arise against a backdrop of growing evidence concerning crimes against children. As reported in The Island (05 October, 2025): “Sri Lanka has witnessed a troubling rise in crimes against children over the past three years, according to a recent National Audit Office Report. Between 2022 and 2024, a total of 8,492 cases—including sexual abuse, murder, and exploitation—were recorded.”

The breakdown of social norms has spilled over into schoolyards, playing fields, and classrooms, bringing into focus the student–teacher relationship and the methods some teachers use to address student misbehaviour. However, authorities must not overlook the challenges faced by teachers—most of whom act within their professional boundaries, often under difficult conditions such as staff shortages and limited institutional support.

Concern over the safety and wellbeing of children is universal. Since the turn of the 21st century, international attitudes toward physical and emotional abuse—both at home and in schools—have shifted markedly. This is due to substantial research showing a strong association between corporal punishment during formative years and negative mental health outcomes in adulthood.

The World Health Organisation has called for greater international awareness, investment in evidence-based prevention, alternative disciplinary strategies, and corresponding legal reforms.

I am not qualified to discuss the legal intricacies of the proposed legislation, but I will focus on the psychosocial aspects of disciplining children in the school setting.

In our culture, teachers have traditionally been revered as surrogate parents, reflected in the terms Guru Piya (teacher–father) and Guru Maaniyo (teacher–mother). This underscores the teacher’s vital role in guiding children through their maturational process. Although teachers and parents serve distinct functions, with some overlap, their collaboration is essential for the holistic development of children.

Teaching is universally regarded as an honourable profession. A teacher’s fundamental role is to facilitate learning—imparting knowledge, developing skills, and nurturing students both academically and personally. Teachers serve as mentors and role models, creating safe and inclusive environments that inspire curiosity, motivation, and critical thinking.

In managing disruptive behaviour, it is vital that teachers remain within professional and ethical boundaries.

Teachers today face increasing challenges in maintaining classroom discipline. A range of disruptive behaviours—defiance, non-compliance, aggression, bullying, fighting, and property damage—demand corrective measures, especially when persistent or severe. Such behaviour disrupts learning and undermines relationships with peers and teachers.

More alarmingly, there are reports of illicit substances being brought into classrooms by a small minority of students, further complicating the situation.

An age-old belief persists in our culture: that reluctant or disruptive students can be “corrected” through physical punishment (gahala haduwa). Many adults even claim with pride that they “became who they are” because of such discipline, seldom acknowledging any lasting emotional scars from their childhood experiences.

Corporal punishment—such as caning or spanking—is intended to inflict physical pain. Another common form of punishment used by some teachers involves humiliation, which inflicts emotional pain.

Critics argue that corporal punishment is inconsistent with our cultural and religious values and, instead, represents a colonial inheritance. One could argue that physical and emotional punishment of children is incompatible with our Buddhist heritage, with its rituals having entered many aspects of our lifestyle. Historically, the temple served as the seat of learning, and Buddhist teaching has never endorsed violence—physical or emotional—as a means of correction. The Buddha’s message was one of loving-kindness toward all living beings.

Some teachers express concern that the proposed legal reforms might penalise those who act “in good faith” (sathbhaweyen). However, teachers who discipline with firmness and compassion—without resorting to violence—should have no cause for fear.

Research consistently shows that physical and emotional punishment predisposes children to maladaptive personality patterns and neurotic traits. Without delving into neurological or hormonal mechanisms, it is evident that both nature and nurture contribute to these outcomes.

Long-term consequences may include low self-esteem, poor interpersonal skill, limited impulse control, mood instability, and difficulties with adaptation. Such individuals are at greater risk of anxiety and mood disorders, psychosomatic illnesses, eating disorders, and substance abuse.

A professionally trained teacher should possess a sound understanding of normal child development, age-related behaviour, and individual differences. To address errant behaviour effectively, teachers must first explore the underlying causes—emotional, social, or environmental—before determining appropriate intervention strategies.

Disruptive behaviour often represents a child’s acting out of emotional distress such as anxiety, anger, or frustration. It may also serve as a non-verbal expression of unmet needs or result from inadequate communication skills. Some children adopt negative behaviours learned from peers or parents who serve as poor role models.

Many severely dysfunctional children—those who feel unloved, insecure, or alienated—come from families marked by domestic violence, alcoholism, parental absence, or marital conflict. This reflects a broader social breakdown. In such contexts, physical or emotional punishment cannot be justified as a corrective measure.

A small percentage of children may exhibit prodromal features of major psychiatric disorders (e.g., Major Affective Disorder or Schizophrenia) expressed in behavioural terms. Early detection and referral to a mental health professional are crucial.

The teacher’s primary responsibility is to provide a safe, respectful, and productive learning environment. Discipline should involve setting limits—clearly and consistently—while safeguarding the child’s physical and emotional wellbeing.

Teachers who combine firmness with empathy and good communication skills are often most effective. Boundaries should be explained clearly, with logical consequences that are fair, enforceable, and aligned with school policy. Compassionate guidance, encouragement, and opportunities for creative and recreational engagement help rebuild self-esteem and foster behavioural change.

Collaboration with parents is key to addressing persistent behavioural issues. Professional development programmes that enhance teachers’ mental health literacy and provide peer support within schools can further strengthen positive discipline practices.

Every school principal has a moral duty to ensure a safe, nurturing environment that supports both academic and emotional development.

Despite growing evidence of the negative consequences of corporal and emotional punishment, such practices remain prevalent in our society. The way forward lies in clear, compassionate guidance, constructive behaviour management strategies, and close collaboration between teachers and parents.

Continued professional development for teachers, and school-based programmes that promote mental health literacy, should be integral to broader education reforms. Ultimately, a national dialogue is needed to shift attitudes toward non-violent disciplinary approaches—both at home and at school—as we strive to protect the dignity and wellbeing of our children.
