HUTCH Sri Lanka has donated Rs 60 million to the ‘Rebuild Sri Lanka Fund’, instantly stepping forward to support the nation rebuilding following Cyclone Ditwah.

The funds from the CK Hutchison Group subsidiary will help rebuild public infrastructure and restore livelihoods across affected communities.

We thank TRCSL, the Digital Ministry, Defense Forces, and the Government for their prompt and decisive efforts to rebuild Sri Lanka.”

Through this donation and its sustained relief efforts, HUTCH reaffirms its commitment as a long-term partner in advancing Sri Lanka’s digital future and supporting its communities in times of urgent need.
