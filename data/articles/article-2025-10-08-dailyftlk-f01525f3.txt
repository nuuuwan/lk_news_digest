Sri Lanka and South Africa have renewed their commitment to deepen diplomatic and people-to-people relations, following the presentation of credentials by Sri Lanka’s new High Commissioner to South Africa, Air Chief Marshal (Retd.) Udeni Rajapaksa, to President Cyril Ramaphosa at the Sefako M. Makgatho Presidential Guesthouse in Pretoria.

During the ceremony, Rajapaksa conveyed the greetings of President Anura Kumara Disanayake and referred to the recent discussion between the two leaders held on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York on 23 September.

He reaffirmed the longstanding friendship between the two nations, highlighting their cooperation within the Commonwealth, the Group of 77, and the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA). Rajapaksa also briefed President Ramaphosa on Sri Lanka’s efforts to establish a Truth and Reconciliation Commission, inspired by South Africa’s own experience, and expressed appreciation for its continued support.

The High Commissioner noted the strengthening of people-to-people ties, particularly through sports diplomacy, with cricket continuing to play a central role in fostering mutual understanding.

President Ramaphosa extended his greetings to President Disanayake and expressed South Africa’s readiness to further enhance bilateral cooperation.

To mark the occasion, Rajapaksa presented a traditional Sri Lankan ceremonial water vessel (Kendiya) to President Ramaphosa, symbolising purity and goodwill.

A 37-year veteran of the Sri Lanka Air Force, Rajapaksa served as its 19th Commander in 2023 and is affiliated with the Institute of Management of Sri Lanka and the Institution of Engineers of Sri Lanka.
