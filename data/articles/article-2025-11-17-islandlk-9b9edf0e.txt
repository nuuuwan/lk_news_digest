Germany seen as strengthening SL’s disease preparedness

Germany reaffirmed its continued commitment to Sri Lanka’s health security and research collaboration through the renewal of funding under its Global Health Protection Programme (GHPP) — a move seen as strengthening both the country’s disease preparedness and its broader economic resilience.

Speaking at the inauguration of the IDEANet One Health Forum 2025 at Colombo University on Monday, German ambassador to Sri Lanka and Maldives, Dr. Felix Neumann, highlighted that the partnership between the University of Colombo and Germany’s Robert Koch Institute (RKI) stands as a model for science-driven development.

“This partnership is a vital investment in health security — and health security is, in essence, economic security, Ambassador Neumann said. “By building laboratory and diagnostic capacity, Sri Lanka is not only improving its preparedness for emerging diseases but also strengthening the foundations for sustainable growth and human capital development.”

The IDEANet collaboration, funded by Germany’s Federal Ministry of Health, has already trained more than 200 Sri Lankan laboratory professionals, established nationwide PCR diagnostic networks and enabled the first-ever detection of Nipah virus in Sri Lanka.

“Research collaboration accelerates innovation, drives knowledge transfer and creates long-term economic value, Dr. Neumann noted, adding that regular exchanges between German and Sri Lankan doctoral students have helped expand expertise and build future-ready talent. “This project exemplifies how international partnerships can deliver both scientific and socio-economic dividends.”

Vice Chancellor of the University of Colombo, Professor Indika Mahesh Karunathilake, described the initiative as a “historic collaboration” that demonstrates the value of interdisciplinary science and institutional partnerships.

“The University of Colombo, the oldest in the country, has long been at the forefront of health research, he said. “The One Health approach unites medicine, science and public health — and that kind of synergy is exactly what Sri Lanka needs to address the complex challenges of emerging diseases.”

Reflecting on the COVID-19 pandemic, Prof. Karunathilake said the experience underlined the importance of scientific networks and evidence-based decision-making. “During the pandemic, strong collaboration between academia and health authorities helped shape national protocols. These investments in diagnostics and training bring tangible returns — in public health and economic continuity alike, he said.

Professor Andreas Nitsche of the Robert Koch Institute outlined the achievements and next steps of the project, which has been active in Sri Lanka since 2017 under Germany’s global health framework.
