Bouquets for Michael de Silva

Ex-Purple Rain Michael de Silva certainly had many eyes focused on him when he performed in Colombo, last month, with a band from Switzerland.

When we highlighted the fact that Michael will be doing his thing in Colombo, even before his arrival, he had plenty of bouquets coming his way, and these are some of the comments that appeared in social media:

One of the best talented musicians – a legend, indeed. All the very best Michael de Silva.

Looking the same Mr. Handsome. Will come to listen to you sing.

A great musician and, most importantly, a great human being.

Congratulations Michael. You are a great legend and we love you.
