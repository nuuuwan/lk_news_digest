Sri Lanka showcases its tourism potential at TTG Travel Experience 2025 in Italy

Sri Lanka made a strong presence at the TTG Travel Experience 2025, Italy’s leading international travel and tourism fair, held from 8 to 10 October 2025 at the Rimini Expo Centre. The Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau (SLTPB), in collaboration with the Consulate General of Sri Lanka in Milan, organized the country’s participation, marking another significant step in strengthening Sri Lanka’s visibility and partnerships in the Italian market.

The Sri Lanka pavilion drew significant interest during the exhibition, with 24 Destination Management Companies (DMCs) from Sri Lanka joining the national delegation to promote the country’s wide range of tourism offerings—from wellness and cultural tourism to adventure, wildlife and experiential travel. The collective effort aimed to position Sri Lanka as a diverse, sustainable and high-value destination catering to the evolving preferences of Italian travellers.

Italy continues to be one of Sri Lanka’s key source markets, showing a steady increase in arrivals in recent years. For the first three quarters of 2025, there is a record increase of 33% of tourist arrival from Italy compared to the similar period of 2024. This growth significantly surpasses the overall increase in tourist arrivals to the country, which stands at 16.2%. Participation in TTG 2025 thus served as a timely opportunity to reaffirm Sri Lanka’s commitment to the Italian market and to rebuild strong B2B and media connections following global travel disruptions.

The three-day event provided a valuable platform for networking, partnership building and destination branding, with Sri Lanka’s pavilion drawing a high level of interest from travel professionals seeking authentic, sustainable and experiential destinations in Asia.
