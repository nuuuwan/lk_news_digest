Prime Lands Residencies’ success story is shared by over 7,200 Sri Lankan investors

The remarkable financial turnaround of Prime Lands Residencies PLC (PLR) is more than a corporate success story; it is a direct financial victory for a broad cross-section of the Sri Lankan public. With a wide public ownership base of over 7,200 investors on the Colombo Stock Exchange, the company’s soaring performance has directly increased the wealth and solidified the investments of thousands of ordinary citizens.

This period of shared prosperity is underscored by the company’s formidable financial foundation, which now boasts a Shareholder Equity of Rs. 10.3 billion. This equity signals not just corporate resilience but also the security of the public’s investment, supporting a market capitalization of LKR 31.9 billion.

The most visible sign of this success for PLR’s vast investor community has been the dramatic rally in its share price, which more than doubled to close at Rs. 34.20. This surge is fundamentally rooted in performance that delivers tangible value to its owners. The key metric for these shareholders, Earnings Per Share (EPS), surged by 72% to LKR 0.58, proving that the company’s growth is directly enriching its large and diverse public base.

Behind this shareholder value is operational excellence. While revenue grew 24% to Rs. 2.84 billion, the real achievement was in profitability, with Gross Profit up 52% and Profit Before Tax accelerating by 74%. This disciplined growth means the company is not just expanding, but creating more value for its thousands of stakeholders.

Company leadership affirmed that this performance is a validation of a strategy designed to build lasting value.

Prime Group Co-Chairperson, Sandamini Perera, stated, “Our focus on timely delivery, transparency, and creating real value is resonating powerfully with both customers and the market.” Echoing this, Prime Group Chairman, Premalal Brahmange, highlighted the commitment to “responsible growth,” which in turn secures the investments of a wide public.

The story of PLR’s latest quarter is therefore clear: a period of significant financial achievement whose benefits are felt not by a select few, but by a community of over 7,200 Sri Lankan investors who have a direct stake in its continued success.
