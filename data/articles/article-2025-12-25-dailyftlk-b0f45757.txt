Morison ‘Suwa Deya’ platform supports cyclone‑affected communities with purpose‑driven action

Helping Sri Lanka rise again through purpose-driven action, Morison, a leading local pharmaceutical manufacturer, recently extended its CSR platform ‘Suwa Deya’ by offering vital medicinal support to communities affected by the recent disaster.

As the Principal Medical Partner, Morison donated medicines manufactured at its own plants, valued at nearly Rs. 4 million, to be distributed in the coming weeks through medical camps organised by Swarnavahini, a leading Sri Lankan TV channel.

The donation reflects the company’s commitment to the nation and reinforces Morison’s purpose of ‘Making Premium Healthcare Affordable’, ensuring essential healthcare remains accessible to communities during this challenging time.

Morison firmly believes that though the recent cyclone has tested the country’s resilience, it has not dimmed Sri Lanka’s spirit. Morison employees came together with compassion and generosity, contributing dry rations as personal donations that were also handed over to Swarnavahini to support the affected families. The collective effort reflects the company’s enduring belief in solidarity and shared responsibility.

With humanity at its core, Morison is committed to bringing hope and healing, standing by the nation in times of adversity and supporting Sri Lanka’s path to recovery.
