Seaspan and Ceyline Shipping celebrate 20 years of partnership excellence

Seaspan Corporation Pte. Ltd., the world’s largest independent charter owner and operator of containerships, and Ceyline Shipping Limited, Sri Lanka’s market leader in Seafarer Recruitment & Placement Services, are celebrating two decades of transformative partnership that has elevated Sri Lanka’s maritime industry on the global stage.

The partnership, established in 2005, has grown from its first deployment of Sri Lankan officers aboard the vessel Dubai Express on December 25, 2005, to become a powerful force in maritime talent development. Today, over 630 onboard Sri Lankan seafarers serve aboard Seaspan’s operating fleet of 241+ vessels, with a total local talent pool exceeding 1,100 professionals.

The collaboration has achieved remarkable milestones, including an industry-leading 95% retention rate and the successful management of 31 vessels fully manned by Sri Lankan ratings between 2023–2024, including seven advanced dual-fuel IGF vessels. The dedicated Seaspan Training Room in Sri Lanka, unique to this partnership, has become a regional center of excellence, providing world-class instruction not only for Sri Lankan crew but for foreign seafarers across Seaspan’s global operations.
