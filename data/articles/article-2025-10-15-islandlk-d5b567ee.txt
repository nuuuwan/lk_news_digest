Direct Kitchens Sri Lanka to design bespoke kitchens for Oceana Villas by Home Lands Skyline

Direct Kitchens Sri Lanka, the local arm of Australia’s leading name in luxury custom kitchen design and manufacturing, has achieved a significant milestone by securing its first commercial order to design, supply, and install 66 premium kitchen units for Oceana Beach Resort Villas, a luxury development by Home Lands Skyline in Wadduwa.

This achievement marks an important step forward for Direct Kitchens Sri Lanka following the successful opening of its Experience Centre in Colombo earlier this year. With more than four decades of experience in creating world class kitchens, Direct Kitchens has earned a reputation for craftsmanship, design excellence, and innovation. Its entry into Sri Lanka continues to raise the standard for premium kitchen and cabinetry solutions for discerning homeowners and developers.

The partnership with Home Lands Skyline for the Oceana project brings together Australian design expertise and Sri Lankan elegance. Each kitchen will be carefully crafted to complement the Balinese inspired architecture of Oceana Villas, featuring refined finishes, superior materials, and functional design. The kitchens will embody the perfect balance of style and practicality, elevating the luxurious coastal living experience that Oceana Villas promises to deliver.

Commenting on this milestone, Amaya Herath, Director of Direct Kitchens Sri Lanka, said, “Securing our first commercial order within months of launching in Sri Lanka is a proud moment for us. Oceana Villas represents the pinnacle of luxury living by the coast, and we are delighted to bring Australian design innovation and craftsmanship to this prestigious development. Our goal is to create spaces that combine elegance, quality, and functionality while enhancing the overall experience of modern living.”

Situated along the scenic Wadduwa coastline, Oceana Beach Resort Apartments and Villas is a premium residential project that offers 66 private villas with stunning ocean views and over 50 resort style amenities including fine dining restaurants, wellness spaces, a gym, and recreational areas. The project has been designed to offer a serene and exclusive lifestyle inspired by tropical luxury and contemporary architecture.
