Govt. raises flood-relief home cleaning assistance to Rs. 25,000

In line with the directive issued by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, in his capacity as Finance Minister, the Ministry of Finance has approved an increase in the assistance granted for cleaning flood-affected houses and property. Accordingly, the support amount has been raised from Rs. 10,000 to Rs. 25,000. This decision is intended to accelerate the restoration of normal living conditions for communities impacted by the Ditwah cyclone.

Treasury Secretary Dr. Harshana Suriyapperuma yesterday said that this decision was taken based on a request made by the Disaster Management Centre and in accordance with the President’s instructions.

A sum of Rs. 7.5 billion has been allocated for this assistance program. This funding has been released from the Rs. 30 billion already earmarked in the national budget for disaster management.

The Secretary further noted that the strengthened financial management practices of the Treasury and the ongoing anti-corruption efforts have made it possible to implement this expanded assistance more effectively.

He added that these allocations will significantly accelerate the restoration of lives and livelihoods in the affected areas.

The mechanism for disbursing the assistance has already been established. Through coordination with Grama Niladhari officers, the funds will be made available to affected households as well as small and medium-scale entrepreneurs.

Dr. Suriyapperuma further stated that, should additional relief be required, the Ministry stands ready to allocate further provisions based on recommendations issued by the Disaster Management Centre
