eChannelling launches eMindCare as holistic digital platform for mental wellbeing

eChannelling has launched ‘eMindCare,’ a first-of-its-kind holistic mental wellbeing platform designed to make expert mental health and psychosocial wellbeing services more accessible, inclusive, and stigma-free.

With psychosocial challenges and mental health issues such as stress, anxiety, and depression on the rise in Sri Lanka, eMindCare addresses a critical gap by combining professional care with holistic practices and mental health education. The platform is designed to support the diverse needs of individuals, families, and groups including students, young professionals, entrepreneurs, and employees in high-pressure industries.

With the launch of eMindCare, eChannelling is reaffirming a commitment to the community, addressing some of the most pressing psychosocial challenges prevalent today. The platform moves past treatment, focusing on empowerment, awareness, and creating a culture where mental well-being is prioritised. The launch of eMindCare demonstrates eChannelling’s role as a responsible digital health leader, committed to improving access to healthcare and providing psychosocial support across the nation.

Available through the eChannelling website at www.echannelling.com, the platform connects individuals to a wide range of services including psychiatry, counselling, yoga, and meditation while also offering educational resources to empower people with the knowledge and tools needed to foster improved mental health.

For users, eMindCare delivers direct access to qualified psychiatrists, counsellors, and wellness practitioners, ensuring expert guidance at every step of any user’s mental health journey.
