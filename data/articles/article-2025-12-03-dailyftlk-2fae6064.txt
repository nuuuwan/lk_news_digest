Global humanitarian support flows into Sri Lanka

State of Palestine, Cuba, Türkiye, Nicaragua, and European among nations and diplomatic missions conveying solidarity

Sri Lanka continues to receive significant international support following the devastation caused by Cyclone Ditwah, which has resulted in hundreds of deaths and left hundreds of thousands displaced across the country. As recovery operations intensify, nations across the world have expressed solidarity while several key allies have mobilised direct relief assistance on the ground, the President’s Media Division said in a statement.

India has taken a leading role in immediate emergency response efforts. Prime Minister Narendra Modi conveyed heartfelt condolences to President Anura Kumara Dissanayake and reaffirmed that India “stands firmly beside Sri Lanka and its people in this difficult hour,” pledging continued support under Operation Sagar Bandhu for relief, rescue and rehabilitation efforts.

He further assured that India will extend “all necessary support” as Sri Lanka moves into recovery. Earlier, India dispatched humanitarian assistance through INS Vikrant and INS Udaygiri, which delivered relief materials in Colombo, with further deployment underway.

The United States strengthened its humanitarian contribution with the delivery of 20,000 polysacks to reinforce embankments and mitigate rising water levels, while additional supplies including generators, cooking stoves, water bins and tents will be provided through the World Food Program (WFP).

Further deepening engagement, US Special Envoy for South and Central Asian Affairs Sergio Gor spoke with President Dissanayake on Thursday, during which the President conveyed Sri Lanka’s gratitude for continued US support.

The United States reiterated its commitment to stand by Sri Lanka, noting that it is closely monitoring the evolving situation and extended deepest condolences to families who have lost loved ones. The call highlighted ongoing cooperation as Sri Lanka faces one of its worst natural disasters in recent years.

In a statement issued from Moscow, Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed his deep condolences, saying: “Please accept my sincere condolences over the numerous human casualties and the extensive destruction caused by the floods and landslides that have struck your country. I ask you to convey words of sympathy and support to the families and loved ones of those who perished, as well as wishes for a speedy recovery to all those injured.”

Australia has pledged AUD 1 million for immediate response and early recovery assistance, while Nepal announced a contribution of $ 200,000 to support relief efforts.

Pakistan has also delivered substantial emergency supplies, with the Pakistan Navy Ship PNS SAIF handing over relief items through the Sri Lankan Navy to support families affected by flooding.  The Maldives confirmed the donation of $ 50,000 along with 25,000 cases of tuna cans, expressing solidarity with Sri Lankan communities affected by the disaster.

Additionally, the Sri Lankan expatriate business community in the Maldives contributed $ 33,000 to ongoing operations.

The United Nations in Sri Lanka is also coordinating efforts with national authorities to support rescue, emergency relief and early recovery initiatives.

Meanwhile, a significant number of partner nations and diplomatic missions have extended messages of sympathy and solidarity.

Cuba, Türkiye, Nicaragua, European Union had conveyed their condolences, as did the State of Palestine which said: “The Foreign Affairs and Expatriates Ministry expresses its deepest condolences and sympathies to the friendly Government and people of Sri Lanka, and to the families of the victims of Typhoon Ditwah, which struck the Sri Lankan island, leaving tens of casualties and displaced tens of thousands of people, leaving behind extensive destruction and great suffering. The Ministry wishes a speedy recovery to the injured and alleviates the suffering of those affected, confirming that the entire State of Palestine stands with the friendly Government and people of Sri Lanka in this cruel humanitarian situation.”

As relief continues to arrive by sea and air, Sri Lanka’s recovery effort is being strengthened by a unified global response, reflecting deep diplomatic partnerships and regional cooperation in disaster management. The government has stated that international coordination remains critical as communities begin the long process of rebuilding homes, livelihoods and essential infrastructure.
