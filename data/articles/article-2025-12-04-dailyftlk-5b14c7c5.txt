The Management Committee of the ‘Rebuilding Sri Lanka’ Fund, established on the instructions of President Anura Kumara Dissanayake to assist the country’s recovery following Cyclone Ditwah, met yesterday morning at the Presidential Secretariat.

The meeting was chaired by Labour Minister and Finance and Planning Deputy Minister Dr. Anil Jayantha Fernando.

The President’s Media Division said the Committee held extensive discussions on mobilising additional funds required to rebuild all sectors affected by the cyclone. Attention was also drawn to strategic measures needed for fundraising, including engaging foreign embassies, international organisations, and overseas Sri Lankan workers.

The meeting further discussed the various ways in which State and private sector institutions, as well as individuals in Sri Lanka, could contribute to the national rebuilding process.
