Justice Minister says Easter Sunday probe details cannot be disclosed

Justice Minister Harshana Nanayakkara told Parliament yesterday that details related to the ongoing investigations into the 2019 Easter Sunday bombings should not be made public while inquiries are still underway.

He said even Parliament should refrain from directing the release of such information, as it forms part of active investigations.

The Minister made these remarks in response to a question from SJB MP Dayasiri Jayasekara, who referenced a statement by MP Nizam Kariapper calling on the Government to identify and disclose the mastermind behind the attacks.

Nanayakkara further noted that efforts to interfere with or influence the investigation process, even indirectly, must be prevented.

Meanwhile, the Ministry of Public Security yesterday dismissed as false the social media claims that its Secretary, retired Senior DIG Ravi Seneviratne, had alleged India’s involvement in the 2019 Easter Sunday bombings.

Police said Seneviratne appeared before the Parliamentary High Posts Committee on 8 October to answer several questions but did not make any remarks implying India’s role in the attacks.

Seneviratne described the circulating posts as completely baseless and intended to mislead the public.

According to police, the Inspector General of Police has been instructed to investigate those responsible for spreading the fabricated report, while Seneviratne has also sought legal action against the individuals behind it.

Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) MP Nizam Kariapper, however, stated on X that Public Security Ministry Secretary Ravi Seneviratne had confirmed the identification of the main conspirator behind the 2019 Easter Sunday attacks.

According to Kariapper, Seneviratne made the remark in response to a question he raised during the proceedings of the Parliamentary Committee on High Posts.

“In reply to my question before the High Posts Committee, Ravi Seneviratne said, ‘We have identified the main conspirator behind the Easter Sunday attacks,’” Kariapper wrote.
