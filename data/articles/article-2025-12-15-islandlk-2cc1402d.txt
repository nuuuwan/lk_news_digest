Addressing a critical shortage of skilled personnel, Melwa is enhancing the professional competencies of construction tradesmen. The leading steel manufacturer recently conducted a specialized workshop in Jaffna for over 100 masons and welders, providing crucial training on the correct use of reinforcement bars and GI pipes.

This initiative directly tackles the industry’s skills gap by educating workers on essential technologies and best practices. In recognition of their participation, all attendees received a certificate and a valuable tool kit from the company. Furthermore, Melwa is funding comprehensive training for a selected group to achieve the prestigious NVQ Level 3 National Certificate, significantly uplifting workforce capabilities.
