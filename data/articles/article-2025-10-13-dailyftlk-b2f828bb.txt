BASL outraged over Police assault on lawyer inside Court

The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) has expressed deep concern and outrage over the assault of an attorney-at-law by a Police officer within the Mount Lavinia Court premises, calling the incident “inexplicable” and urging the Inspector General of Police (IGP) to ensure such acts do not recur.

Issuing a statement, the BASL said: “The BASL expresses its utmost outrage in relation to the incident that took place today (10 October) within the Mount Lavinia Court premises where an Attorney-at-Law was assaulted by a Police officer.

The BASL has always stood firmly against the use of force by Police officers against any person.

The officer concerned has now been remanded and the BASL will closely monitor this matter.

The BASL calls upon the IGP to take all necessary steps and measures, not only to address this matter at hand but also to ensure that such incidents will not take place in the future.”
