Kaspersky has announced its participation as Gold Sponsor of the 43rd National IT Conference (NITC 2025), Sri Lanka’s premier ICT event hosted by the Computer Society of Sri Lanka (CSSL). The conference took place from 14–16 October 2025 at the Shangri-La Hotel, Colombo.

With the theme “Fostering a Human-Centric Nation: Towards Society 5.0,” NITC 2025 brought together more than 30 local and international thought leaders across seven tracks including FinTech, EduTech, TravelTech, InfoSec & E-Governance, AgriTech, eHealth, and eGov.

Kaspersky’s sponsorship underscores its strategic focus on advancing cybersecurity awareness, innovation, and resilience in Sri Lanka, engaging with an audience of over 500 industry leaders, policymakers, and academics.

Mohnissh Manukulasuriya, Territory Channel Manager at Kaspersky, will deliver a session on 16 October 2025, titled “Adopting a Cybersecurity Framework for Resilience with Kaspersky,” focusing on practical approaches for building secure and resilient digital infrastructures.

“As digital transformation accelerates across industries and public services, the urgency to embed security by design in every system has never been greater,” said Sam Yan, Head of Sales for Asia Emerging Countries at Kaspersky “By supporting NITC 2025 as a Gold Sponsor, we aim to deepen our collaboration with Sri Lanka’s ICT ecosystem and empower professionals, academics, and policymakers to build safer, more trustworthy infrastructures.”

Kaspersky regularly publishes threat intelligence reports, local insights, and country-specific analyses that shed light on the latest risks, challenges, and opportunities facing organizations. In Sri Lanka, this includes providing updates on emerging malware trends, ransomware activity, data protection concerns, and sector-specific vulnerabilities, alongside recommendations and best practices in the local context.

By making these insights accessible to businesses, government bodies, and the wider community, Kaspersky contributes to building stronger awareness and preparedness against both global and Sri Lanka-specific cybersecurity threats.

As a Gold Sponsor, Kaspersky reinforces its commitment to Sri Lanka’s cybersecurity maturity, partnering with events such as NITC that provide a valuable platform to engage directly with stakeholders shaping the country’s digital future.
