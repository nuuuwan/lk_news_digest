SLTPB hosts French media tour featuring rugby legend Serge Betsen

The Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau (SLTPB) took a leading role in an initiative to showcase Sri Lanka as a premier tourist destination in France and Europe by hosting a dedicated media tour from France. The tour coincided with the visit of celebrated French national rugby player Serge Betsen, who was in Sri Lanka from 17–20 November 2025, as part of a special promotional initiative organized by the Sri Lanka–France Business Council, the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, and Asia Rugby.

During the tour, the French media team received comprehensive exposure to Serge Betsen’s engagements, including rugby training sessions, CSR initiatives, speaking engagements, and social events, providing rich content to highlight Sri Lanka’s vibrant tourism and sports culture. Their coverage played a crucial role in enhancing awareness of Sri Lanka among French audiences and positioned the country not only as a top travel destination but also as a hub for sports tourism and youth development.

In addition to event coverage, SLTPB organized a familiarization tour for the media group, allowing them to experience Sri Lanka’s cultural, natural, and heritage attractions first-hand. The itinerary included iconic destinations such as Kandy, Galle, Sigiriya, Polonnaruwa, Habarana, and Bentota, showcasing the country’s rich diversity and hospitality. The journalists’ experiences during the tour will be widely shared, reaching millions of potential travellers in France and across Europe.

This initiative highlights the central role of SLTPB in hosting international media, leveraging high-profile personalities like Serge Betsen, and strategically promoting Sri Lanka as a vibrant and desirable tourism destination.
