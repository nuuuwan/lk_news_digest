co-energi facilitates Diamond Cutters to achieve LEED Gold Certification for new expansion

Diamond Cutters Ltd., recently completed its latest state-of-the-art facility, which has been awarded LEED Gold Certification, marking its second LEED-certified building.

Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), developed by the US Green Building Council, is one of the world’s most widely recognised green building certification systems, promoting energy and water efficiency, improved indoor environmental quality, and environmentally responsible construction. The facility features high-efficiency chillers, optimised HVAC systems, smart automation, and advanced ventilation.

For Diamond Cutters, the certification is not just an environmental milestone but a strategic market advantage. Global buyers increasingly favour manufacturers that can demonstrate verified sustainability performance, and LEED Gold strengthens the company’s brand equity, Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) alignment, and competitive positioning.

co-energi Ltd., served as the sustainability and engineering consultant for both of Diamond Cutters’ LEED-certified facilities and also provided mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) consultancy services for the newly constructed building, contributing to the development of a high-performance, energy-efficient, and future-ready manufacturing facility.
