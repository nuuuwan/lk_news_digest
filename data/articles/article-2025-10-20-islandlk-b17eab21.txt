‘Two Years of Smiles, Happiness and Shared Joy’ at Havelock City Mall

Havelock City Mall, Colombo’s premier lifestyle destination, celebrated its second anniversary over the weekend under the theme “Two Years of Smiles, Happiness and Shared Joy” — marking two vibrant years of redefining urban living through shopping, dining and entertainment.

Speaking at the Havelock City Mall Tenant Partner Excellence Awards 2025 held on October 18, Chief Operating Officer of Havelock City Mall, Mohammad Ghazanfar Ali, said the event was designed to honour the invaluable contribution of tenant partners who continue to make the mall “Colombo’s most dynamic lifestyle hub.”

> “On behalf of our marvellous team at Havelock City Mall, I would like to thank each one of you who has taken the time to be here this morning for our first-ever Tenant Partner Awards, Ali said. “This concept is the first of its kind in the country—not just to meet all our partners, but to celebrate the performers and the effort behind our collective success.”

He explained that the winners were selected purely on performance metrics, such as sales turnover, trading density per square foot and customer feedback. A special category of awards was determined through public voting, which attracted more than 7,000 responses via social media.

“We are thrilled by the overwhelming response from the public. It reflects the strong connection between Havelock City Mall and our shoppers, Ali added. “This initiative will become an annual tradition to recognise excellence, encourage innovation and celebrate the people who make our mall truly special. Everyone here—winners and nominees alike—is part of this journey, and everyone is a winner.”

The ceremony brought together representatives from 135 tenant partners, members of the Havelock City Mall management team and senior executives of Overseas Realty (Ceylon) PLC, the developer and owner of Havelock City.

Chief Executive Officer of Overseas Realty (Ceylon) PLC, Pravir Samarasinghe, commended the tenant partners for their continued trust and support.

> “As we celebrate this milestone, I extend my heartfelt gratitude to our shoppers, retail partners and vendors for their unwavering trust, Samarasinghe said. “I also congratulate all our deserving winners who have exemplified excellence and partnership throughout this journey. Together, we have made Havelock City Mall Colombo’s most cherished and joyful destination—my happy place.”

The awards recognised excellence across 19 categories, ranging from sales performance to customer service and innovation, underscoring the collaborative spirit that drives Havelock City Mall’s success.

To commemorate the occasion, Havelock City Mall hosted a two-day anniversary celebration on October 18 and 19. Shoppers were treated to exclusive discounts of up to 30%, hourly lucky draws with 200 winners, an international food fiesta and live entertainment throughout the weekend—transforming the mall into a lively festival of joy.

Adding to the excitement, the mall launched a new loyalty card exclusively for Havelock City apartment residents, offering a range of privileges and special benefits at participating outlets.
