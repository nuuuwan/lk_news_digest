Sri Lanka adds two more Bat Species to Its Mammal Record

Sri Lanka’s bat researchers have confirmed the presence of two free-tailed bat species never before recorded in the country, marking a significant expansion of the island’s known mammal diversity.

The breakthrough documented by Dr. Tharaka Kusuminda and his team; Amani Mannakkara, Bruce Patterson, Chamara Amarasinghe and Professor Wipula Bandara Yapa, adds both Wroughton’s free-tailed bat (Otomops wroughtoni) and the East Asian free-tailed bat (Tadarida insignis) to Sri Lanka’s bat fauna. The findings were published following extensive acoustic surveys conducted across the central highlands and tea-estate landscapes.

Speaking to The Island, Dr. Tharaka Kusuminda, lead author of the study, said the discovery reshapes what scientists know about the island’s molossid bats.

“These two free-tailed bats were long suspected to occur in Sri Lanka, but until now we lacked verified evidence,” Dr. Kusuminda explained.

“Our acoustic data clearly match the species-level characteristics documented in India and Nepal, leaving no doubt that both species are part of Sri Lanka’s bat community.”

The team captured nine echolocation call series of Otomops wroughtoni and 19 of Tadarida insignis from tea plantations in Kotagala, Gammaduwa, Kotapola, Balangoda and Nuwara Eliya.

Dr. Kusuminda noted that the calls were unmistakable:”The peak frequencies, call structures and pattern sequences all aligned perfectly with published data from India and the Himalayan region. These species are extremely fast fliers, difficult to observe visually, so acoustic identification was the only reliable method.”

The discovery of Otomops wroughtoni in Sri Lanka is particularly remarkable. Classified by the IUCN as Near Threatened, the species is known for its rarity and limited distribution.

Previous records placed the species mainly in the Western Ghats and parts of Northeast India. The Sri Lankan acoustic matches fell tightly within the known call frequency ranges documented from Indian colonies.

“The presence of Wroughton’s free-tailed bat suggests strong biogeographical connectivity with the Western Ghats,” Dr. Kusuminda said.

“Its low-frequency echolocation calls, around 16 kHz on average, were distinct and consistent across all localities.”

The study also recorded the East Asian free-tailed bat, Tadarida insignis, with an even lower mean peak frequency of 12.51 kHz. The bat’s extremely shallow FM (frequency-modulated) calls were well differentiated from other South Asian molossid species. Dr. Kusuminda said the species may have been overlooked for decades:

“The call structure of Tadarida insignis is very similar to the calls of other molossids, but when analysed carefully, the frequency drop and bandwidth make clear distinctions. Without acoustic tools, detecting this species would have been nearly impossible.”

Local mammalogists say the discoveries highlight the importance of sustained acoustic monitoring.

Senior bat researcher Prof. W. B. Yapa, who has extensively documented Sri Lankan mammals, welcomed the new additions:

“Sri Lanka’s bat diversity is richer than often assumed. Acoustic surveys, combined with advanced statistical methods like PCA, are now proving essential to uncover hidden biodiversity.”

International experts have also taken note. The study shows that call patterns in Sri Lankan individuals fall well within the ranges published in India and Nepal, suggesting low geographic variation in key call parameters.

One of the more surprising aspects of the study is the habitat: commercial tea estates.

Dr. Kusuminda said these modified landscapes may offer ideal flying corridors:

“Open spaces above tea cover allow free-tailed bats to maintain the high flight speeds they require. Our recordings show repeated use of these habitats, especially at dawn and dusk.”

Time-gap analyses between call series—ranging from 1 minute 28 seconds to nearly 9 hours—suggest the same individuals were not being repeatedly counted, strengthening the validity of the findings.

Sri Lanka now hosts four confirmed molossid bat species, and the findings call for increased conservation attention.

“Some of these species may be using small roosts, fissures or building structures that go unnoticed,” Dr. Kusuminda cautioned.

“With more survey effort, we may uncover even more cryptic species.”

He said ongoing landscape development—especially in highland regions—must consider the needs of fast-flying aerial insectivores.

The discovery comes at a time when global bat populations face growing threats from habitat loss, climate change and disease. For Sri Lanka, two newly confirmed species add weight to the island’s position as a biodiversity hotspot.

Dr. Kusuminda concluded: “Sri Lanka’s bat fauna continues to surprise us. Our work shows that with the right tools, we can reveal species that have been here for decades, undetected. This is only the beginning.”
