Celebrations … at Broadway

Broadway, situated at Station Road, Dehiwela, has now become the choice of many, when it comes to good food … and music, of course.

This restaurant opened its doors to the public on 26th October, 2024, and it’s celebration time this Friday, 24th October.

In addition to a yummy spread of dishes, Roger Menezes, from Australia, will be providing the music for the anniversary celebrations.

In fact, Roger was the very first artiste to be featured at The Broadway, and that was on Valentine’s Day, 14th February, 2025, and now Roger has turned out to be a drawcard at Broadway.

Several other known artistes have been featured at this restaurant, including Mignonne, Manilal and Benjy.

I’m told the management has plans to feature many other artistes as they embark on their second anniversary.

Roger Menezes is a very versatile artiste who has performed with some of the top outfits in the scene here before making Australia his home, many years ago.

He makes regular trips to Sri Lanka to entertain his fans and he says he is working on a special repertoire for his gig at Broadway on Friday, 24th October.
