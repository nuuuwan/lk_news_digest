Ceylon Chamber urges govt to convert fiscal gains into productive investment

The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce has acknowledged the government’s recent fiscal gains but is urging a strategic shift of these surpluses into productive public investment to secure long-term growth.

In its review of the National Budget 2026, the Chamber endorsed the government’s “clear trajectory” of fiscal consolidation and disciplined debt management, noting this consistency is crucial for Sri Lanka’s ongoing economic recovery.

However, with the initial post-crisis consumption boom now moderating, the Chamber stressed that the government must pivot from consolidation to investment. It identified targeted capital expenditure in infrastructure, energy, tourism, and digital services as the potential new engines needed to drive the economy forward.

Significantly, the Chamber revealed that 18 of its policy proposals were incorporated into the budget, which include:

Trade: Developing a Trade National Single Window and a new Tariff Policy to phase out para-tariffs.

Investment: Implementing a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) framework, a digital single window for approvals, and a new residence visa scheme for investors.

Digital Economy: Plans to issue the first Digital ID in 2026, roll out 5G licensing, and eliminate service fees for online government payments.

Land & Tourism: Advancing a National Land Use Plan and resuming the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) expansion project.

Despite these welcomed inclusions, the Chamber highlighted three critical areas requiring greater focus:

Bridging the Implementation Gap: The Chamber warned that execution with clear timelines is the ultimate test, emphasizing that promises on the Trade Single Window and PPP laws must be delivered on time.

Strengthening Tax Administration: Improving compliance and widening the tax net through better enforcement was deemed more critical than further rate increases.

Improving Public Sector Efficiency: The Chamber argued that the reform agenda is at risk without “substantial improvements” in institutional capacity and inter-agency coordination.

The Chamber also noted a missed opportunity, stating the budget lacked a “targeted investment incentive package” essential for attracting the large-scale, export-oriented investments needed to achieve the government’s 7% growth target.

Furthermore, the Chamber called for clarity on the proposed Economic Transformation Act and urged the government to fast-track legislation for State-Owned Enterprise (SOE) and PPP reforms.

Concluding its comments on the Budget, the Chamber reaffirmed its commitment to collaborate with the government, underscoring that “sustained delivery” on these reforms is the only way to convert current economic stability into durable, broad-based growth.
