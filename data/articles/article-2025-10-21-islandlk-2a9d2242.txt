The new Cold War is made of gold: A weapon against the dollar

In 2024 and 2025, the world witnessed something extraordinary: gold, that ancient metal once thought to belong to kings and temples, suddenly became the new obsession of investors, governments, and even central bankers. Prices shattered all records, soaring past US$4,100 per ounce, doubling within a single year. Analysts scrambled to explain what was happening. Was this another bubble? A panic? Or something deeper—perhaps the beginning of a historic financial realignment?

The truth, as it turns out, lies not in the usual economic explanations of inflation or interest rates, but in two bigger and longer-lasting transformations reshaping the global financial landscape: the financialisation and the weaponisation of gold.

Gold’s appeal has always gone beyond its glitter. From the tombs of the Egyptian pharaohs to the coins of the Roman emperors, gold has symbolised permanence and power. It became the ultimate standard of trust—the promise behind every paper note and national currency.

But the old “gold standard” system, which linked currencies directly to gold, had a dark side. It kept prices stable, yes, but at the cost of human suffering. When economies slowed, governments were forced to cut spending and raise interest rates to protect their gold reserves; policies that deepened recessions and unemployment. Mining itself was brutal, leaving scars on people and the planet.

When the United States finally abandoned the gold standard in 1971, many thought gold would fade into history. Yet, half a century later, gold is back—not as money in your pocket, but as a shadow currency in the portfolios of the powerful.

Fast-forward to the 21st century. Gold’s comeback has been powered not by miners but by markets. The launch of Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) —financial products that let anyone buy or sell gold with a few clicks—has turned an ancient commodity into a modern investment craze.

Before ETFs, buying gold meant storing heavy bars or coins. Today, a college student can own gold on their phone app. This democratisation of access has led to massive inflows, more than US$60 billion in just nine months, according to the World Gold Council.

This surge in financial participation has changed gold’s very nature. It now moves less like a raw material and more like a stock, rising and falling with global risk appetite and social media sentiment. The “fear of missing out” (FOMO) effect has amplified every uptick, creating powerful feedback loops: rising prices attract new investors, whose enthusiasm drives prices even higher.

What was once a hedge against crisis has become, ironically, a product of financial exuberance. Gold is now as much a part of Wall Street as it is of the jewellery trade.

But there’s another, far more serious driver of this golden surge, one that reaches into the heart of global politics. In the last few years, central banks in China, Russia, India, and other emerging economies, have been buying gold at a record pace. Why? To protect themselves from the dominance of the US dollar, and the political power that comes with it.

When Western nations froze Russia’s dollar reserves, after the invasion of Ukraine, and blocked its access to global payment systems, like SWIFT, it sent a chilling message to other countries: your savings are only safe as long as Washington allows it

. In response, these countries began quietly shifting their reserves into gold, a neutral, physical asset that can’t be digitally seized or sanctioned.

Russia’s Central Bank now holds one of the world’s largest gold piles. China, too, has been a relentless buyer, increasing its official gold reserves every month, since 2022. For them, gold is not just an investment—it’s an insurance policy against Western financial power.

This is what economists call “de-dollarisation”: a gradual move away from dependence on the US dollar. Gold, with no flag or central bank of its own, is the only truly global form of money left.

This geopolitical gold rush has created a form of price-inelastic demand; meaning countries will buy gold no matter how expensive it becomes. They aren’t chasing profits; they’re seeking safety. This type of demand places a firm floor under gold prices, making future crashes less likely and rallies more sustainable.

In other words, this isn’t a temporary boom. It’s a structural revaluation; a rewriting of what gold is worth in an age of political and digital fragility.

For the first time since the Cold War, the world is moving toward multiple financial poles. On one side, the dollar-based Western bloc; on the other, a growing coalition of countries building their own “sanctions-proof” reserves. Gold sits at the centre of this new global contest, quietly, gleaming, unaligned.

Not everyone will lose in this new era. Countries rich in gold resources (like Australia, South Africa, and Canada) are emerging as quiet beneficiaries of this geopolitical reordering.

Australia, already a mining powerhouse, has seen gold exports skyrocket. If current trends continue, gold could overtake coal and iron ore to become the country’s second-largest export within the next two years. For a nation navigating the energy transition and trade tensions, the timing couldn’t be better.

For investors, gold has regained its reputation as a “safe haven,” but with a modern twist. It is now both a defensive asset and a speculative vehicle, blending ancient psychology with algorithmic trading. While some analysts, like Goldman Sachs, predict prices could reach US$4,900 by 2026, others warn of volatility if peace returns or interest rates rise sharply.

Still, even skeptics admit gold is no longer just reacting to crises—it’s part of the crisis-proofing itself.

Why does gold, of all things, endure when entire currencies come and go? Part of the answer lies in human psychology. Gold is tangible, immutable, and universal. It glitters the same way in Beijing, Moscow, or Colombo. It is an anti-digital asset in an increasingly virtual world, unchanged by code, hacking, or political decree.

This emotional dimension, as economists now admit, carries real financial power. In times of social distrust and institutional decay, tangible symbols of permanence, like gold, become repositories of faith.

As one trader put it recently, “You can’t print gold, and you can’t freeze it.”

For many developing nations, gold accumulation is not just economic; it’s existential. Countries in the Global South have learned painful lessons from debt crises, currency collapses, and the volatility of foreign aid. Gold offers them a rare form of monetary sovereignty.

Sri Lanka, for example, has faced severe balance-of-payments challenges and currency depreciation. While it cannot match the gold-hoarding power of China or Russia, its policymakers now openly discuss diversifying reserves beyond dollars and euros. For smaller nations, even modest gold holdings can serve as a symbolic statement of independence and resilience.

In this sense, the “Goldasization” of the global economy represents a subtle but profound shift in power, from the financial centres of the West to the resource and production centres of the Global South.

Yet, this transformation is not without risk. The more gold becomes a political weapon, the more volatile its price could become. If major powers begin to hoard rather than trade, gold markets could tighten dramatically, distorting their role as a neutral store of value.

Moreover, the human and environmental cost of new gold mining could once again rise as demand surges. Already, illegal and unsafe mining has reappeared in parts of Africa and Latin America, raising questions about sustainability and ethics.

So, while gold may shine bright, it casts long shadows, just as it did centuries ago.

Gold’s story is, in many ways, humanity’s story: our longing for permanence in an uncertain world. It survived the fall of empires, the rise of digital currencies, and even the invention of Bitcoin. Each time it seems obsolete, it reinvents itself.

Today, in a world divided by politics, debt, and data, gold is once again uniting investors and governments in their search for something that lasts. Whether this new “gold standard” will bring stability or new inequalities remains to be seen.

But one thing is certain: the golden age is not behind us, it’s being remade before our eyes.
