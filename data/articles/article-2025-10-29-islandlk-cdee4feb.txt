Sri Lanka welcomes ‘Hello, to More’ as GWM and David Pieris Automobiles announce strategic partnership

David Pieris Automobiles (Private) Limited (DPA), the four-wheeler sales arm of the David Pieris Group of Companies, has been appointed as an authorised seller and distributor for GWM, a global automotive giant, in Sri Lanka. The partnership brings to local customers a new generation of hybrid Plug-in hybrid and new energy vehicles (NEVs), combining advanced technology with greater choice, reliability and value.

The launch portfolio includes the Haval H6 Hybrid (HEV) Plugin hybrid (PHEV) and the Haval GT Plug-in Hybrid (PHEV), offering Sri Lankan customers the freedom to drive electric in the city with the assurance of petrol power for longer distances. These models address the twin needs of efficiency and readiness, delivering everyday fuel savings while ensuring range confidence beyond urban limits. Alongside these, DPA will also introduce the Tank 300 Hybrid, the Tank 500 Hybrid, and the fully-electric ORA, expanding the choice available to local drivers.

The launch introduces GWM’s signature philosophy “Hello, to More”, a welcoming promise that emphasises the human benefits of freedom, trust and value, while paving the way for the global brand positioning “Go With More” as familiarity grows in the Sri Lankan market.

GWM has established a strong global footprint with operations in more than 100 countries. Its HAVAL H6 is the number one SUV in Australia within its category, recognised for reliability, performance and value, cementing GWM’s leadership in the competitive global automotive market. Through DPA’s nationwide presence and over four decades of legacy, Sri Lankan customers will now have access to GWM’s global expertise backed by the after-sales trust, service and reach of the country’s most extensive mobility network.

The portfolio now available through DPA redefines mobility for Sri Lanka by delivering choice with purpose. Customers are no longer forced to compromise between efficiency, performance, or readiness. GWM’s hybrid and electric vehicles offers a complete spectrum of advantages: the range flexibility of electric in the city and petrol beyond, the economy to make every day journeys cost-effective, and the performance of instant e-torque combined with petrol power when needed most.

Importantly, this is underpinned by nationwide service accessibility and the credibility of DPA’s 40+ year legacy. Together, these attributes form a strategic mobility solution that equips Sri Lankans with the freedom, resilience, and confidence to embrace the future of transport today.

Each model introduced to Sri Lanka reflects this promise in a distinct way. The Haval H6 brings lifestyle sophistication, appealing to families and urban professionals seeking comfort and technology. The Haval GT embodies grit, designed for those who demand style and power in equal measure. The Tank 300 delivers adventure, built for drivers who want freedom beyond city limits, while the Tank 500 commands presence, offering space, luxury and authority on the road. Through these personas, GWM and DPA are curating experiences that meet diverse aspirations while shaping the future of mobility in Sri Lanka.
