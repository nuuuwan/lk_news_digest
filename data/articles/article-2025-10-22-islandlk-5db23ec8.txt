AIA Insurance takes Sri Lankan creativity to the world with major wins at Dragons Awards

AIA Insurance Lanka Limited has made a powerful impression across Asia, earning prestigious recognition at the Dragons of Asia Awards 2025 for its innovative and purpose-driven campaign, Suwa Walan. The campaign was honoured with the coveted Blue Dragon Award for ‘Best Campaign in Sri Lanka’ and a Gold Award for ‘Cause, Environment & Sustainability’, positioning AIA among the region’s most creative and socially impactful brands.

This regional success was built on strong local acclaim, with Suwa Walan sweeping multiple accolades at the Dragons of Sri Lanka Awards 2025, including a Gold Award in the ‘Event or Experiential Category’ and two Black Dragons for ‘Innovative Idea/Concept’ and Cause, Environment & Sustainability’ categories. These achievements showcase how Sri Lankan creativity and cultural insight can resonate powerfully on the global stage.

The award-winning campaign, Suwa Walan, was developed to inspire healthier living and create lasting change in communities across Sri Lanka. Executed together with AIA’s longstanding charity partner the Sri Lanka Cancer Society, it is a culturally rooted awareness campaign aimed at promoting early detection of breast cancer. Drawing inspiration from the traditional Sri Lankan practice of examining clay pots (walan) for imperfections, the campaign cleverly connects this familiar ritual to the importance of breast self-examination. The main tool used in this campaign was handcrafted clay pots embedded with symbolic lumps and visual cues, designed to simulate the experience of identifying irregularities. This artistic and tactile approach encouraged women to engage with the concept of self-checks in a non-intimidating, relatable, and memorable way.

What set Suwa Walan apart was its innovative fusion of cultural storytelling, health education, and visual art. By leveraging a deeply ingrained cultural metaphor, the campaign broke down barriers around breast health conversations and empowered women to take proactive steps in monitoring their well-being. Today, this initiative has garnered multiple accolades for its creative excellence and social impact that resonates with local communities.
