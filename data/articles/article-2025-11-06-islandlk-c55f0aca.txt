Building Sri Lanka’s economic future through smarter cities

Each year on November 8, planners around the world celebrate  World Town Planning Day—a moment to reflect on how planning can build fairer, greener, and more prosperous societies. The 2025 theme, “With Planning We Can!”, reminds us that planning is not just about regulating land use—it is about shaping the destiny of nations.

In Sri Lanka, urbanization is one of the most powerful forces defining our development pathway. Yet, over the decades, urban growth has remained uneven—concentrated in a few regions while vast areas with great potential, from the North to the East and from Uva to the South, remain underdeveloped.

To achieve true national prosperity, Sri Lanka needs a  comprehensive, balanced, and inclusive National Urban Development Policy—one that integrates all provinces, strengthens regional economies, and ensures that every city, town, and village contributes to a shared national vision.

Because with planning, we can build a future where every region matters.

Urbanization is often a mirror of economic transformation. Countries such as Singapore, South Korea, and Malaysia used planning-led urban growth to accelerate their economies. Sri Lanka, however, continues to experience slow and spatially fragmented urbanization.

While the official urbanization rate stands at around 19%, the reality is far more complex. When peri-urban and functionally urban regions are included, nearly half the population already lives in areas economically tied to cities. Yet much of this growth is unplanned—spreading linearly along roads and lacking efficient infrastructure.

This has resulted in congestion, high service delivery costs, and widening disparities between regions. Western Province, with 28% of the population, contributes nearly 44% of GDP. Meanwhile, provinces like the Northern, Eastern, and Uva—rich in resources and human potential—remain underutilized.

To correct this imbalance, Sri Lanka’s urbanization must be  guided, strategic, and regionally balanced.

Sri Lanka’s settlement pattern is diverse. The country is composed of:

· Core Urban Populations – Residents of municipal and urban councils.

– Areas around main cities with growing housing and employment links.

– People living on the edges of rural and urban zones, economically tied to nearby towns.

– Towns that provide services to rural hinterlands but lack urban-scale infrastructure.

From Jaffna to Galle, Kandy to Trincomalee, and Kurunegala to Badulla—these settlement types coexist, but not always in coordination. A new approach must weave them together into a single national system of Functional Urban Areas (FUAs)—connected by economy, mobility, and governance.

Sri Lanka’s development challenge is not lack of talent or resources—it is unequal spatial development.

· Western Province dominates economically, yet faces congestion, high land costs, and overuse of infrastructure.

have vast land, skilled populations, and coastal trade potential, yet remain under-industrialized.

possess rich natural and cultural assets that can drive sustainable tourism and agro-industries.

hold strong manufacturing and fisheries potential but require better connectivity.

Balanced national development means every province becomes part of the growth story. The future must not be a competition between regions, but a network of interconnected, complementary city regions—each contributing uniquely to Sri Lanka’s prosperity.

To manage growth wisely, Sri Lanka must adopt a structured, forward-looking framework. The National Urban Development Policy envisions a system of Livable Cities 2060, based on three guiding principles:

· Logical Urbanization – Guiding population and investment toward areas where infrastructure, employment, and services coexist efficiently.

– Compact, green, inclusive, and resilient urban regions ensuring quality of life for all.

By 2060, Sri Lanka will feature a balanced network of compact, climate-ready, and well-connected urban regions that support equitable economic growth and a high standard of living.

– Compact land use, vertical development, and function-based city classification.

– Evidence-based decision-making, institutional reform with favorable laws, and professional capacity building.

As we commemorate World Town Planning Day 2025, Sri Lanka stands at a turning point. The next phase of national growth must be planned, inclusive, and regionally balanced.

From Colombo to Jaffna, from Kandy to Batticaloa, from Galle to Anuradhapura—each region has a vital role to play in shaping our collective future.

A well-crafted National Urban Development Policy can bridge regional divides, modernize our cities, and ensure prosperity reaches every community.

Because ultimately, with planning, we can build one Sri Lanka—united in vision, diverse in strength, and equal in opportunity.
