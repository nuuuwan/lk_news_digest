Dialog Axiata PLC, has renewed its strategic partnership with the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) to further their shared mission of driving positive transformation and sustainable progress across Sri Lanka through impactful social development initiatives spanning multiple sectors.

The renewed partnership seeks to amplify the outcomes of a series of ongoing and future development projects across critical sectors including digital transformation, financial inclusion, gender equality, disaster risk reduction, education, and agriculture.

Through this collaboration, Dialog and JICA aim to deliver innovative, scalable, and inclusive solutions that address the needs of vulnerable communities, particularly those most affected by the prevailing economic challenges, thereby advancing national resilience and socio-economic development. Since 2023, JICA has also been a key partner in supporting Dialog’s Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives, collaborating on a range of impactful programs aimed at fostering equality and empowerment across communities.

Looking ahead, the partnership will place greater focus on renewable energy projects, implementing women’s empowerment programs that foster independence and self-reliance in rural communities, and driving joint efforts towards poverty alleviation. Both organisations also aim to work together on initiatives that combat gender-based violence through awareness and education campaigns, strengthening their shared vision of creating a safer, more equitable society.

JICA Sri Lanka Office Chief Representative Kenji Kuronuma said: “By bringing together JICA’s global development expertise and Dialog’s cutting-edge technological capabilities, we are confident that this partnership will deliver scalable, people-focused solutions to address Sri Lanka’s pressing socio-economic challenges. Our shared goal is to contribute meaningfully to resolving the country’s key development challenges and to supporting its long-term, sustainable progress.”

Dialog Axiata PLC Group Chief Executive Supun Weerasinghe said: “Our renewed partnership with JICA reflects a shared commitment to advancing Sri Lanka’s development priorities and uplifting communities across the country. By working together on initiatives that strengthen essential services, expand opportunities, and improve everyday lives, we aim to create lasting, inclusive progress for all Sri Lankans. We look forward to building on this collaboration to deliver meaningful impact at scale.”

Through this strengthened alliance, Dialog and JICA reaffirm their dedication to building a more resilient and equitable Sri Lanka, leveraging their combined expertise and resources to drive enduring progress and social impact across the nation.
