Sri Lanka’s largest youth and pop culture celebration rescheduled to January 2026

Gamer.LK, the organisers of Play Expo and Colombo Comic Expo, wishes to inform the public that the upcoming editions of both events have been rescheduled to 10 and 11 January 2026 at the Sri Lanka Exhibition and Convention Centre. This decision was made with everyone’s safety and wellbeing in mind, following the natural disaster that has impacted the country.

All tickets purchased, existing registrations for the Esports tournaments, cosplay competitions, and other event activities will remain fully valid for the new dates. Participants who have registered for online Esports titles will be provided with updated match schedules.

Munchee Savory is the Platinum Partner, with gaming powered by Coca-Cola. Mentos joins as the Freshness Partner, Anchor Newdale as the Dairy Partner, Wonder as the Frozen Treats Partner, Scope Cinemas as the Cinema Partner, Lenovo as the Technology Partner, and InGame Esports as the Tournament Platform Partner for the event.

As Sri Lanka focuses on recovery and rebuilding, Gamer.LK stands with all those affected during this difficult time. Gamer.LK extends its sincere appreciation to the partners and community for their understanding, and continued support, and looks forward to welcoming everyone in January 2026.
