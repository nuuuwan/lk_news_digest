The Consequences Of Inappropriate Sex Education In Sri Lanka: A Theological & Biblical Response

Recent remarks by His Eminence Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith, Archbishop of Colombo, have reignited national conversation on sex education in Sri Lanka. Speaking at the reopening of St. Stephen’s Church, Meerigama–Kinadeniya, the Cardinal warned that the proposed “sexual education program,” influenced by international agencies, could undermine the nation’s moral and cultural values. “Is this really education? Isn’t it the parents’ responsibility to teach such matters to their children at the right time?” he asked (Colombo, November 9, Daily Mirror).

His concern reflects a deep pastoral responsibility. Yet it also raises a crucial question: Who today is truly equipped to give children a moral and holistic understanding of human sexuality? In reality, many parents lack the knowledge, confidence, or language to address this sensitive issue. For generations, sex has been treated as taboo—rarely discussed with dignity or theological understanding. This silence has created a vacuum now filled by social media, pornography, and peer influence. Thus, while parents carry the primary responsibility, they need the support of the church, schools, and the government to ensure that children receive education that is accurate, age-appropriate, and morally grounded.

When sexual education is introduced without ethical and spiritual grounding, it produces moral confusion—children may learn biological facts without understanding moral responsibility. It fosters distorted identity (LGBTIQ), where sexuality becomes self-focused rather than relational and covenantal. It also increases vulnerability to exploitation, as uninformed youth are easily misled into early sexual activity or emotional harm. Most critically, there is spiritual erosion when God’s original design is excluded, reducing a sacred gift to a mere physical act. Education that separates knowledge from moral formation informs the mind while deforming the human soul.

A responsible and holistic approach to sex education must begin not only in biology but also in theology—with the conviction that human sexuality is a divine creation, not a human invention. Scripture says, “Male and female He created them” (Gen. 1:27). Human sexuality expresses God’s intention for relationship, covenant, and life’s continuity.

According to John Stott, the creation of man and woman “establishes both equality and complementarity; neither is superior, and each needs the other for the fullness of humanity.” The Imago Dei—being made in God’s image—means that male and female together reflect God’s relational nature. Stanley Grenz notes that sexual differentiation “belongs to the created goodness of human existence and is the means by which humans reflect divine relationality.”[2]

Sexuality was designed for intimacy, companionship, procreation, and self-giving within covenantal love (Gen. 2:24). As Christopher Wright affirms, God’s creation order of marriage is “both physical and moral—rooted in covenantal fidelity and mutual blessing.”[3] Pope John Paul II similarly teaches that the body “speaks the language of gift.”[4] Therefore, sexual ethics are inseparable from spiritual integrity, for “your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit” (1 Cor. 6:19–20).

However, sin has fractured this divine design. Since the human Fall (Gen. 3), human sexuality has been distorted through lust, adultery, abuse, and identity confusion (LGBTIQ). Yet, as Stott reminds us, “the Fall did not destroy the image of God in man and woman, but it defaced it. Redemption restores God’s original design and moral order.”[1] Theologically, sin did not change God’s design for sexuality but distorted how humans relate to that design—turning what was meant for covenantal love into self-centered desire.

Christ provides the model of redemptive grace in human brokenness. He reaffirmed the creation order of marriage (Matt. 19:4–6) and met the sexually broken with compassion, not condemnation (John 8:3–11). To the woman caught in adultery, Jesus said, “Neither do I condemn you… Go now and leave your life of sin” (John 8:11). His response embodies truth with grace—the foundation of Christian sexual ethics.

Christian teaching on sexuality should reflect God’s redemptive grace—inviting healing and transformation rather than producing guilt or condemnation. It defines truth to set moral boundaries, extends grace to empower change, and challenges individuals to repentance and transformation. Wright writes, “human relationships are renewed to express justice, faithfulness, and joy—mirroring God’s own covenant grace.”[3]

The church, therefore, must be a community of integrity, offering pastoral care rather than condemnation, upholding chastity before marriage and fidelity within it, and modeling holy love in a culture of confusion. As Vinoth Ramachandra notes, in societies where sexuality is commercialized or silenced, “the church must live as a community of truth and grace, celebrating the dignity of embodied life under God.”[5]

1. Sexuality is God’s good creation for covenantal love and life.

2. Sin has distorted, but not destroyed, this divine intent.

3. Christ redeems and restores our desires under His Lordship.

4. The Spirit empowers believers to embody holiness, integrity, and compassion.

In Sri Lanka, this theology speaks prophetically—challenging permissive liberalism on one side and fearful silence on the other. It calls the church to provide biblically grounded education and pastoral care, affirming every person’s dignity as made in God’s image. True sex education must lead not just to information, but to formation—helping individuals live under God’s gracious design for human flourishing.

Sri Lanka needs a collaborative model of moral and sexual education involving parents, religious bodies, schools, and the government. Parents must nurture love, openness, and moral dialogue at home. The church should shape conscience and spiritual understanding through sound theology and appropriate teaching. The government and schools must ensure scientific accuracy, well-trained teachers and ethical sensitivity in curricula. No single institution can succeed alone. If the state offers knowledge without morality—or religion teaches morality without understanding—both will fail.

Sri Lankan culture values modesty, dignity, and mutual respect. Effective sex education should affirm these values—promoting respect for life and fidelity, upholding the worth of both men and women, integrating scientific knowledge with ethical and spiritual discernment, and fostering responsibility and reverence. We must avoid copying permissive Western models that undermine moral order, yet we must also reject silence that leaves young people uninformed and vulnerable.

Sex education, when stripped of moral foundation, corrupts; but when rooted in biblical truth and ethical integrity, it protects, informs, and transforms. The question is not whether to teach it—but how and on what foundation? To refuse education is to abandon the next generation; to teach it wrongly is to mislead them.

The Bible urges, “Train up a child in the way he should go; even when he is old, he will not depart from it.” (Prov. 22:6). Our children deserve an education that unites wisdom with purity, science with faith, and knowledge with character—an education that builds not only minds but souls, restoring to Sri Lanka a vision of human dignity grounded in God’s truth and grace.
