Nature Didn’t Fail Us – Our Policies Failed Nature In Sri Lanka

Storms will come, rain will fall, and climate patterns will shift. But we can prevent human tragedy if we work with nature instead of fighting it. Nature protects us when we respect its systems. But when we alter the land, drain the wetlands, strip the hillsides, and build where we should not, then nature strikes back, and it strikes hard. What we are facing today is not just a natural disaster. It is a governance disaster. Sri Lanka destroyed the very ecosystems that used to defend us, despite warnings from scientists, hydrologists, and engineers. it is the result of decades of short sighted decision making. And unless we start planning responsibly, building sustainably, and respecting the land that carries us, these tragedies will repeat again and again.

Current flood and landslide devastation is not purely a natural misfortune but a predictable consequence of long standing systemic failures in construction governance, engineering oversight, and unethical procurement practices that have allowed the degradation of the central highlands through unchecked resource extraction and ill-considered building approvals.

for decades, poorly regulated construction permits, uninformed environmental planning, and decisions driven by political influence rather than scientific evidence have directly weakened the country’s natural defences.

when government offices authorize quarrying of mountain rock, deforestation, sand mining and building on unstable slopes without proper geotechnical modelling or sustainable procurement, we strip the land of its natural stabilizers. Global precedents illustrate the same dynamic.

Brazil’s 2011 Rio de Janeiro landslides showed the consequences of illegal hill construction; Nepal’s post earthquake recovery proved the danger of uncontrolled extraction; and even Japan’s Hiroshima disaster taught the need for ecological zoning and regulated land usage.

Sri Lanka must now enforce sustainable procurement frameworks (e.g. ISO 20400), environmental certifications (LEED/IGBC), and transparent approvals backed by scientific risk assessments rather than signature-based approvals. Critically, good procurement and supply chain management are not bureaucratic formalities. They are essential to building a safer nation. Ethical procurement can prioritize green building materials, eco designed infrastructure, solar powered construction sites, recycled aggregates, low carbon cement technologies, cold formed steel, engineered timber alternatives, and innovations that reduce strain on natural ecosystems.

A properly designed supply chain reduces waste, lowers transportation emissions, minimizes inventory surpluses, and prevents unnecessary extraction of new material shifting Sri Lanka from a consumption driven model to a restoration driven model.

Complementing that, a strengthened logistics network, including regional warehouses, pre positioned emergency supplies, predictive demand modelling, and climate responsive logistics planning are ensures rapid disaster response and saves lives. furthermore, a national “NO- TOUCH NATURE” policy must be enacted for environmentally sensitive regions: no sand mining, no rock blasting, no commercial soil excavation, no unauthorized timber cutting, and no destabilizing construction in red zone terrain are protected by digital surveillance, geological zoning, GIS mapping, and legal enforcement.

Good procurement, sustainable supply chains, and smart logistics will uplift engineering practice moving Sri Lankan engineering away from brute force earth modification toward precision based, eco aligned, digitally guided, and resilience focused construction.

This shift will also accelerate green-energy adoption, reduce national dependence on heavy material extraction, promote circular economy building practices, and cultivate engineering ethics aligned with nature-preservation principles. These reforms are not optional they must be written into Sri Lankan national construction law, urban development policy, procurement regulation, school curriculum, and professional engineering standards. From childhood onward, every Sri Lankan should learn that responsible development is not anti growth, it is the only form of growth that ensures survival. ultimately, we must stop viewing nature as an unlimited resource and begin treating it as our greatest protective infrastructure. only then can Sri Lanka rebuild stronger, safer, and greener through ethical procurement, intelligent supply chain management, scientifically sound engineering, and a government policy framework that finally respects the land that sustains us.
