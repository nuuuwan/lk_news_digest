President vows to prevent racist divisions

Party leaders and representatives welcome initiative, commending effort to create an inclusive national celebration

President Anura Kumara Dissanayake on Saturday reaffirmed that every citizen must have the freedom to live with dignity while respecting all religious and cultural identities, stressing that the Government will not allow the country to fall into any form of racist trap.

He extended an open invitation to all political parties to support the Government’s efforts to strengthen unity and communal harmony.

The President made these remarks during a meeting held at the Presidential Secretariat to brief representatives of Tamil and Muslim Opposition parties on preparations for the upcoming ‘Sri Lanka Day’, scheduled for December.

The President described ‘Sri Lanka Day’ as a national initiative designed to bring together all communities, promote mutual understanding, and build a peaceful and harmonious nation.

Party leaders and representatives welcomed the initiative, commending the effort to create an inclusive national celebration and offering their own proposals for its organisation.

Opposition representatives assured the President of their full support for the national “A Nation United” mission aimed at defeating the drug menace, as well as the broader Government programme to foster inter-religious and inter-ethnic harmony.

They noted that, under President Dissanayake’s leadership, they are prepared to extend unconditional backing for national efforts that safeguard unity and coexistence.

Extensive discussions were held regarding the organisational structure of the ‘Sri Lanka Day’ celebrations, coordinated by the Buddhasasana, Religious and Cultural Affairs Ministry.

Dissanayake instructed officials to organise the event in a manner that ensures participation from all citizens regardless of political affiliation, religious belief or cultural identity.

He stressed that the celebrations must take place on a common platform, reinforcing the message that Sri Lanka’s future lies in collective strength rather than division.
