Cabinet approves restructuring of the Sri Lanka Housing Development Finance Corporation Bank and the State Mortgage and Investment Bank

The Sri Lanka Housing Development Finance Corporation Bank, incorporated under the Sri Lanka Housing Development Finance Corporation Bank Act No. 7 of 1997, is a licensed specialized bank listed on the Stock Exchange.

The prime objective is to provide housing finance and other related services. The State Mortgage and Investment Bank, established under the State Mortgage and Investment Bank Act No. 13 of 1975, is a fully state-owned licensed specialized bank that provides housing-related mortgage credit facilities. Both of these banks are relatively small financial institutions with a small market share.

The Central Bank of Sri Lanka has indicated that the current business models of these banks are unsustainable due to their limited deposit-raising capacity, poor profitability, and inability to meet minimum capital adequacy requirements.

Accordingly, the Cabinet of Ministers has approved the proposal presented by the President, in his capacity as the Minister of Finance, Planning, and Economic Development, to take necessary steps to transfer all the shares of the Government of the Sri Lanka Housing Development Finance Corporation Bank to the Bank of Ceylon and to continue operations as a subsidiary bank of the BOC Bank, and to acquire all the shares of the State Mortgage and Investment Bank for the People’s Bank and to continue operations as a subsidiary bank of the People’s Bank, with the objective of ensuring the stability of the entire banking
