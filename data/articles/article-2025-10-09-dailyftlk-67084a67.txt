Why Sri Lanka: Investor perspectives at SLEIS 2025

As Sri Lanka transitions from economic stabilisation towards a path of accelerated, inclusive growth, with a renewed emphasis on private sector–led development, Day 2 of the Sri Lanka Economic and Investment Summit 2025, organised by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, will host a dedicated session titled “Why Sri Lanka – Investor View”.

The session will examine how strategic investments, and export expansion, among other key strategies, can contribute to increasing national output and per capita income, and how investors view this trajectory, and will open with a keynote address by IFC South Asia Regional Director Imad Fakhoury.

He oversees IFC’s strategic investments and advisory interventions in South Asia, leveraging the World Bank Group (WBG) to promote sustainable private-sector led growth and accelerate the region’s transition to a greener, more inclusive, and resilient development model. Fakhoury focuses on innovative products and transformative technologies, encouraging global and regional integration, strengthening capital markets, and increasing competitiveness.

A panel discussion following the keynote will bring together leading voices from diverse industries to share practical insights on the investment climate and what it will take to attract and sustain long-term capital.

Joining Fakhoury in the discussion will be Axiata Group, Berhad Group CEO/MD Vivek Sood, Variosystems Ltd., Managing Director Thevan Satheeswaran, Unilever Sri Lanka Chairman/CEO Ali Tariq, and CHEC Port City Colombo Ltd., Deputy Managing Director Thulci Aluwihare. The session will be moderated by 5-hour International Corporation Ltd., COO Kasturi C. Wilson.

SLEIS 2025 will take place on 2-3 December at the Shangri La Hotel Colombo.
