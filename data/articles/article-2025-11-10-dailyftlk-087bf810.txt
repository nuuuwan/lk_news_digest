hSenidBiz reports robust growth with significant margin expansion

2Q revenue up 23% YoY to Rs. 517 m, new deal closures up 48%

hSenid Business Solutions PLC (hSenidBiz) has announced its financial results for the second quarter of FY2026, reporting robust topline performance and substantial margin expansion as the company approaches a critical profitability milestone. Total revenue for the quarter reached Rs. 516.9 million, reflecting year-on-year (YoY) growth of 23% both LKR and USD constant currency terms.

The PeoplesHR Cloud segment continued to drive performance, recording a strong 34% YoY increase in LKR terms and 35% in USD constant currency. Recurring revenues contributed 72% of total revenue, reinforcing the quality and sustainability of the company’s revenue base.

New deal closures for the quarter amounted to $ 381,931, a 48% increase compared to the same period last year, with 76% of deals attributed to the PeoplesHR Cloud business.

Founder and Chairman Dinesh Saparamadu said: “The combination of accelerated revenue growth and expanded margins validates our strategic approach. We continue to execute our long-term plan with discipline and are firmly on track to achieving the milestones we set out a few years ago. Our immediate focus centres on reaching sustained profitability, strengthening our sales pipeline in overseas markets, and capitalising on the competitive advantages our product innovations will deliver to customers.”

Normalised EBITDA margin (adjusted for one-off staff restructuring expenses) reached 11%, more than quadrupling the 2.5% recorded in 1Q FY26, marking a substantial improvement that positions the company at the cusp of Normalised EBIT break-even, a critical milestone that reflects the effectiveness of operational discipline and revenue scaling.

hSenidBiz reported a net loss of Rs. 25.9 million, which included the one-time staff restructuring expense of Rs. 25.5 million. Free cash flow, after adjusting for the cash outflow related to this one-off restructuring, remained positive.

CEO Sampath Jayasundara said: “We are seeing tangible results from our unwavering focus on building a resilient recurring revenue model. Approaching Normalised EBIT break-even represents a significant milestone, and we remain committed to strengthening our market position through product innovation and disciplined execution.”

These agentic AI features are designed to elevate customer experience and productivity, further strengthening hSenidBiz’s competitive position in the HR technology market.
