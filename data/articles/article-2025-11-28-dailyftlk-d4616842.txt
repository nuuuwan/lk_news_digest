TVS Lanka Ltd., has hosted the TVS Knowledge Centre NVQ Certification Ceremony on 29 October, at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH) reinforcing its longstanding commitment to technical excellence and the development of Sri Lanka’s skilled workforce. As a private organisation in the country officially recognised by the Government to offer NVQ Level 4 certification through National Apprentice and Industrial Training Authority (NAITA) and the Tertiary and Vocational Education Commission (TVEC) for motorcycle technicians, TVS Lanka marked an important milestone in strengthening vocational education within the automotive sector.

At this landmark ceremony, 210 Private Garage Mechanics (PGMs) received their NVQ Level 4 certifications, formally acknowledging their advanced technical capabilities in motorcycle repair, maintenance, and service. Their training and assessments were conducted entirely through the TVS Knowledge Centre, a dedicated institute established to cultivate practical expertise and bridge the gap between classroom instruction and evolving industry demands. Since its inception, the TVS Knowledge Centre has worked closely with the NAITA and TVEC to deliver accredited, high-quality training aligned with national vocational standards. The growing number of certified technicians reflects the success of this public–private collaboration and TVS Lanka’s broader vision of elevating professional standards across Sri Lanka’s two-wheeler ecosystem.

TVS Lanka Chief Executive Officer Geethal Anthony said, “As one of the leading automobile brands in the country, TVS is delighted to contribute to this transformation of the country’s most valuable asset—the human resource of the nation.” He emphasised that the Knowledge Centre stands as a catalyst for upskilling thousands of aspiring technicians, ensuring they are prepared for the demands of a modernised mobility landscape.

Deputy General Manager – Human Resources and Administration Lasantha Gunawardena added, “This initiative is aimed at uplifting the skill level and competencies of the Sri Lankan automobile workforce so they can compete even at a global level — and it is highly valuable as this is done entirely free of charge.” He highlighted TVS Lanka’s firm belief in democratising access to technical education, particularly for youth seeking structured learning pathways and recognised certification.

The ceremony drew the participation of several esteemed dignitaries and industry leaders from Sri Lanka and India. Representing TVS Mobility Ltd., India, G. Srinivasan Raghavan, TVS Lanka Ltd., Director and Chairman and TVS Mobility Ltd., Managing Director, attended as Chief Guest, accompanied by TVS Mobility Ltd., Vice President P.K. Kannan.

Also in attendance were TVS Lanka Ltd., Director and Commercial Credit & Finance PLC Chief Operating Officer Rajiv Casie Chitty, along with members of the TVS Lanka leadership team including  Geethal Anthony, Dayani Thulshika, Chief Financial Officer, and senior management representatives.

The event was also attended by First Secretary of the Indian High Commission Saurabh Sabhlok, as well as NAITA Vice Chairman and Director General P.A.D.S.F.D. Appuhamy, together with NAITA’s management team. Representatives from the Tertiary and Vocational Education Commission (TVEC), partner institutions, and other distinguished stakeholders including Eng.

TVS Lanka reaffirmed that the success of the NVQ Certification Ceremony is not only a celebration of individual achievement but also a meaningful step toward advancing  Sri Lanka’s vocational talent pool.
