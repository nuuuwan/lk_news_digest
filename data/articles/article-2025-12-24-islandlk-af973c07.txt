The Avenue Colombo unveils new dining experiences for holiday season

The Avenue Colombo recently welcomed the festive season by introducing a refreshed culinary and hospitality experience, centered on comfort, connection, and versatile dining. More than a formal launch, the event felt like a warm gathering of long-time patrons and new friends, all sharing in the brand’s signature hospitality.

Guests previewed new menu additions and the return of modernized classics, alongside the debut of the Front Porch Café @ The Avenue. This relaxed space is designed for casual coffee, meals, and conversation, answering a growing desire in Colombo for welcoming, familiar environments.

The evening also highlighted the popular mist-cooled backyard garden – an eco-friendly, BYOB-friendly oasis perfect for relaxed gatherings. The Avenue now offers fully customized menus for private events across these versatile spaces.

Culinary highlights featured Australian Prime Steaks, ranging from 250g to a impressive 2000g, complemented by a curated wine list and a high-end cocktail bar. “This is a new chapter with the same heart – good food, honest flavors, and a place where people can truly relax,” shared the culinary team, emphasizing a commitment to guest-driven experiences.

As The Avenue looks ahead, its focus remains on genuine hospitality, great food, and comfortable spaces for every occasion.

Since opening in 2019, The Avenue Colombo has established itself as a premier dining destination, offering premium Australian prime steaks, American-inspired cuisine, curated wines, and signature cocktails. Its versatile spaces cater to everyday dining, private celebrations, and business events.
