Money for Sili Sili bags: Setting the record straight

As of 1st November, the free distribution of “Sili Sili” (shopping) bags has officially come to an end. Acting under a directive issued by the Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA), supermarkets and other retail outlets across Sri Lanka have begun charging customers for the thin, low-density polyethylene (LDPE) bags handed over at cashier counters.

The move — part of a long-delayed effort to curb plastic pollution — has already shown encouraging signs. Within just two days of implementation, the daily circulation of shopping bags across the island has dropped significantly, according to the Central Environmental Authority (CEA).

“This is a long-awaited step towards changing public behaviour,” said Kapila Mahesh Rajapaksha, Director General of the Central Environmental Authority (CEA).

The Director General told The Island: “For years, we’ve tried to reduce the dependence on single-use plastics, but awareness alone wasn’t enough. Now, we finally see a measurable decline in daily plastic waste generation.”

The policy was the result of coordinated efforts by multiple institutions — including the Ministry of Environment, the CEA, the Waste Management Division, the Legal Affairs Division, and the Consumer Affairs Authority — all supported by the proactive intervention of the Deputy Solicitor General’s office.

Environmental advocacy groups such as the Centre for Environmental Justice also played a pivotal role in pushing for this regulatory change. “It’s encouraging to see collaboration between agencies and the legal sector to make something happen that has been discussed for nearly a decade,” Rajapaksha added.

The CEA notes that the move is already creating behavioural shifts among consumers. “We are seeing more people bringing their own reusable bags. That’s exactly what this policy was designed to achieve,” Rajapaksha said.

While the new rule has been widely discussed — and in many cases, supported — across social media, it has also sparked several recurring questions and misconceptions. Officials have taken the time to clarify the key points raised by the public.

Rajapaksha explained that while recycling is indeed a vital part of waste management, it’s not always practical for LDPE bags. “These thin plastics are hard to collect, clean, and recycle economically,” he said. “Because the cost of producing recycled pellets is almost the same as making new plastic, there’s very little commercial incentive. So, expecting to recycle all 20 million bags used daily in Sri Lanka is simply unrealistic.”

The CEA Director General warned that so-called “biodegradable” plastics often mislead the public. “Most of these contain additives like calcium carbonate that break the bag into microplastics, not into harmless organic matter,” he explained. “That makes the problem worse — not better.”

Truly eco-friendly bio-based plastics do exist, but their production cost is much higher. “No business will give away a Rs. 10–15 bag for free,” Rajapaksha noted.

Does charging money mean the bag quality will improve or deteriorate?

“The price is not about the bag quality — it’s about discouraging unnecessary use,” Rajapaksha said. “When you pay for something, even a small amount, you think twice before taking it.”

The first two days of implementation have proven this behavioural shift: consumers are bringing reusable bags, and daily plastic waste has already dropped.

“Primary packaging — the first layer that holds the product — is mandatory. But the second bag given at the cashier is not,” he explained. “That’s why the rule specifically targets these ‘secondary’ or ‘thin’ bags, which are optional.”

Rajapaksha dismissed the concern. “This is just the start. The upcoming Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) regulation will make manufacturers responsible for the plastic waste they create. The funds collected will be channelled into proper environmental management. This system will ensure transparency and accountability,” he said.

The CEA maintains that this measure is about changing public habits rather than generating revenue. “When people stop expecting free bags and start carrying their own, that’s when real progress happens,” Rajapaksha emphasised.

Social media, too, has played a surprising role. “We’re glad to see so many citizens expressing support for this move. Constructive dialogue and shared responsibility can turn this small step into a national transformation,” he said.

As Sri Lanka continues to battle the mounting plastic waste crisis — with over 20 million “Sili Sili” bags used daily before the ban — the decision to charge for shopping bags marks a turning point. Whether it leads to lasting behavioural change will depend on sustained enforcement, business cooperation, and the public’s willingness to adapt.

“If we all take this seriously, the benefits will go far beyond cleaner streets,” Rajapaksha concluded. “It’s about reshaping how we live with the environment — one small bag at a time.”
