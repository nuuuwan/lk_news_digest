Sri Lanka’s Northern Gateway: Economic promise and geopolitical power in the Indian Ocean

*  The Northern Province contributes around 3–4% to the national GDP, primarily through agriculture, fisheries, and services.

*  The Eastern Province contributes approximately 5–6%, driven by agriculture, fisheries, tourism, and port activities (Trincomalee).

*  Combined, the provinces account for roughly 8–10% of Sri Lanka’s GDP, despite facing infrastructure and development challenges.

*  Provincial economic growth rates have been higher post-conflict due to reconstruction, with digital infrastructure investments and trade corridor development stimulating local economies. (Figure 1 and 2)

The Northern and Eastern Provinces together represent the economic performance of the island’s former conflict-affected regions. Their combined contribution to Sri Lanka’s total GDP has fluctuated between 9% and 10% from 2019 to 2023, showing both recovery and structural limitations in regional growth. (Figure 3)

*  Declining Trend Overall (2019–2023) *  The combined GDP share of Northern and Eastern Provinces declined slightly from 9.9% in 2019 to 9.2% in 2023. *  This shows a marginal fall of 0.7 percentage points over five years, suggesting that growth in these provinces has not kept pace with the Western, Central, and Southern provinces. *  Northern Province Recovery in 2023

*  Northern Province’s share fell from 4.7% (2019) to 4.0% (2022) but rebounded to 4.5% (2023), possibly due to post-pandemic recovery in fisheries, agriculture, and service sectors. *  Eastern Province Gradual Decline

*  Eastern Province’s share declined steadily from 5.2% (2019) to 4.7% (2023), marking a 0.5 percentage point fall, reflecting slower industrial and infrastructure growth compared to other regions.*  Western Province Dominance

*  Western Province continues to dominate, maintaining 44% of national GDP in 2022–2023, which is nearly five times the combined GDP share of the Northern and Eastern Provinces.*  Structural Imbalance*  The data highlights regional disparities in economic development. Despite improvements in infrastructure, the Northern and Eastern economies remain relatively under-industrialised, heavily dependent on agriculture and public sector employment.

*  The combined Northern and Eastern economic contribution is stagnant, not keeping pace with national growth.*  The Northern Province’s small rebound in 2023 could signal localised improvements but remains below pre-pandemic levels.*  To ensure balanced national growth, targeted investment in transport, renewable energy, fisheries, and SME development in these regions is crucial.

*  Northern and Eastern provinces together have millions of acres of arable land, including paddy fields, vegetable lands, and cash crops.

*  Agriculture remains the primary economic activity, with major products including: *  Paddy (both Maha and Yala seasons) *  Big onions (Jaffna and Kilinochchi)*  Chilies, vegetables, and pulses*  Coconut and sugarcane in Eastern Province *  Fisheries: Both provinces have extensive coastlines, providing livelihoods for over 50,000 fishing families.*  Potential exists to increase yields using modern irrigation, technology, and market linkages.

*  Northern Province: Small-scale industries, handicrafts, ICT services, and tourism (Jaffna cultural sites). *  Eastern Province: Port-related industries (Trincomalee), livestock, salt production, and eco-tourism.*  Digital economy: Investments in e-governance, digital payments, and ICT hubs are gradually increasing, linking producers and consumers.*  Provincial economic diversification is critical for reducing dependence on agriculture and fisheries.

*  Both provinces are integrated into the national health system, providing free or subsidised healthcare.

*  Challenges remain in infrastructure, equipment, and specialist availability, especially in rural areas.

*  The population is predominantly rural, with high participation in agriculture, fisheries, and small-scale trade.

*  Youth employment programmes in digital skills, tourism, and entrepreneurship are underway to reduce underemployment.

*  Literacy rates are improving, providing a foundation for skill-based economic growth.

The Northern and Eastern Provinces of Sri Lanka, together covering nearly one-third of the island’s land area, hold immense yet underutilised potential in driving the country’s balanced and inclusive development. Although these provinces contribute a relatively modest 9–10% of national GDP, they possess unique natural resources, specialised economic activities, and strategic advantages that make them vital to Sri Lanka’s long-term growth and development.

Bordered by the Indian Ocean and the Bay of Bengal, the Northern and Eastern Provinces form the island’s northern and eastern coastal belt. Their location provides strategic advantages for maritime trade, fisheries, and regional connectivity with South India and Southeast Asia. Key ports, including Kankesanthurai, Point Pedro, and Trincomalee, further enhance their potential as hubs for logistics, shipping, and energy development.

The Eastern Province features fertile plains and expansive lagoons, along with mineral resources such as clay, limestone, and mineral sands, vital for construction and industrial sectors. The Northern Province, with its coastal lagoons and inland water bodies, supports rich fisheries and salt production.

Agriculture is a cornerstone of both provincial economies, with paddy cultivation dominating in districts like Ampara, Batticaloa, Kilinochchi, and Mannar. Crops such as onions, chilies, vegetables, and palm products supplement local incomes. Livestock farming, particularly dairy production, further contributes to rural livelihoods and food security.

The provinces collectively account for nearly two-thirds of Sri Lanka’s coastline, anchoring the island’s fisheries industry. Coastal waters are rich in tuna, cuttlefish, prawns, and other high-value species. Key fishing centres include Jaffna, Mullaitivu, Mannar, and Trincomalee. Post-war recovery and modernised fishing techniques have improved productivity, though challenges remain in infrastructure, cold storage, and market access.

Tourism is a growing opportunity, with pristine beaches such as Nilaveli, Pasikudah, and Casuarina, alongside historic and religious sites like Nallur Kovil, Koneswaram Temple, and Kantharodai ruins. Managed effectively, tourism can generate employment, income, and regional revenue, while showcasing the provinces’ cultural richness.

Investments in digital infrastructure, e-governance, and smart health systems are also enhancing service delivery efficiency.

*  Natural resources: Fertile lands, rivers, coastal zones, and port facilities

*  Agriculture: Paddy, onion, chili, vegetables, and livestock*  Tourism and culture: Historical sites, religious landmarks, and eco-tourism*  Digital adoption: E-services, payment systems, and ICT capacity building

*  Human capital: Educated youth, skilled workers, and resilient communities

*  Limited industrialisation and private-sector engagement*  Seasonal water scarcity in some districts

Integrating the Northern and Eastern Provinces into the national economy requires:

*  Targeted investment in transport, ports, irrigation, and rural industries

*  Strengthened governance and local administration*  Youth entrepreneurship and access to finance

*  Sustainable utilisation of fisheries, agriculture, and renewable energy resources

The Northern and Eastern Provinces, though smaller contributors to GDP, are critical for Sri Lanka’s inclusive growth, food security, and cultural identity. Their rich natural resources, strategic location, and human capital present opportunities for sustainable development. Targeted investments in infrastructure, agriculture, fisheries, health, and skills will not only enhance provincial growth but also promote equitable development, sustainable livelihoods, and regional integration into the national economy.
