Morison’s Paracetol champions child safety at Swarnavahini Children’s Day celebrations

Morison, a true Sri Lankan pioneer in pharmaceutical manufacturing, with a rich legacy of over 60 years of industrial expertise, was the Official Safety Partner for the Swarnavahini Children’s Day celebration held at Viharamahadevi Park, Colombo on 5th October 2025. The event hosted over 1,500 children and parents keenly participating in active engagement. The celebration reaffirmed Morison’s commitment to child safety and community health, highlighting the distinctive qualities, making Paracetol (Paracetamol Tablets BP 500 mg) stand out among other paracetamol brands in Sri Lanka.

As part of its role as the Official Safety Partner, Morison launched a significant safety initiative exceeding expectations of the day’s festivities. The company donated fully equipped first aid boxes to 30 under-privileged schools and 10 pre-schools island wide, selected by the Ministry of Education, accompanied by a one-year commitment to replenish these essential supplies, facilitating sustained access to basic medical necessities for thousands of children in the country creating meaningful impact.

Throughout the day, healthcare professionals conducted interactive safety and first aid awareness sessions, educating children and parents on essential emergency response skills and health safety practices. These engaging educational sessions combined practical demonstrations with fun activities, making crucial first aid tips accessible and memorable for young participants.

The combination of fun activities, educational content, safety awareness programs, and meaningful donations created a memorable experience, reinforcing Morison’s position as a trusted healthcare partner for Sri Lankan families.

In a first-of-its-kind initiative for Sri Lanka’s pharmaceutical industry, Morison awarded 20 lucky parents with exclusive factory tours of Morison’s state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Homagama. The extraordinary openness allows consumers to witness firsthand the rigorous quality standards and advanced manufacturing processes behind every tablet or liquid manufactured in the facility, which ranges from OTC products to niche and novel therapies. It will help build trust and confidence, educating the public about pharmaceutical manufacturing excellence in Sri Lanka.

Morison’s Paracetol 500 mg tablet is distinguished in the Sri Lankan pharmaceutical market for its comprehensive local manufacturing approach. Unlike most paracetamol brands available in Sri Lanka importing intermediary forms for compression and packaging, Paracetol’s entire manufacturing process, from raw materials to finished goods, is conducted at Morison’s state-of-the-art pharmaceutical manufacturing facility in Homagama.

Building on this, Morison has also launched Paracetol Pediatric Syrup, manufactured to the same stringent quality standards, offering Sri Lankan parents a safe and reliable choice for their children’s healthcare needs.
