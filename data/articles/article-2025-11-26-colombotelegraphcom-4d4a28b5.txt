A Challenge To Multiculturalism: The Biased History Of The Sri Lankan Department Of Archaeology

The Department of Archaeology (DoA), the official guardian of Sri Lanka’s ancient heritage, stands at a critical juncture. Although tasked with preserving the history of all communities, its institutional operations—from appointments to top posts to field activities—are widely criticized for displaying an overt, improper bias towards the Sinhala Buddhist heritage. This bias fundamentally questions the principles of ethnic reconciliation and peace the nation seeks.

· Emblem and Symbol: The DoA’s official logo features a Stupa (Pagoda) at its center. This is the most significant form of Theravada Buddhist architecture in Sri Lanka, serving as a principal symbol of Sinhala Buddhist antiquity and worship.

· While the Department’s work encompasses a broad range of archaeological sites, critics view the selection of the Stupa as the sole primary visual symbol for the nation’s archaeology as a disregard for the historical significance of Hindu, Muslim, Christian, and prehistoric sites.

· This design choice positions the DoA as the protector of Buddhist antiquities rather than the impartial custodian of all antiquities.

Bias is most evident in the appointment of high-level institutional officials and advisory committee members.

· Political Appointments and Cabinet Control: Since the transfer of power from the British administration, the highest post, Director-General (DG) of the Department of Archaeology, has almost always been filled by members of the Sinhala Buddhist majority community. Appointments are typically nominated by the relevant Minister (often the Minister of Buddhasasana) and approved by the President and the Cabinet. Critics argue that this arrangement prioritizes Buddhist interests over the balance and impartiality necessary for a national archaeological body.

· Marginalization of Minority Scholars: The appointment of scholars from the Tamil, Muslim, and Christian communities to the Department’s highest, permanent leadership positions is historically absent or extremely rare. This lack of diversity at the decision-making level ensures that the perspectives, historical narratives, and conservation priorities of minority communities continue to be overlooked.

· Token Representation: In response to severe public and political criticism, some government-appointed bodies, such as the Presidential Task Force for Archaeological Heritage Management in the Eastern Province, have included token members from the Tamil or Muslim communities. Critics say this does not substantially help change policy but merely serves to legitimize the Sinhala-centric agenda.

This bias of the DoA has led to severe ethnic tensions, particularly in the North and East, involving land grabbing and the desecration of minority places of worship. Conflicts at Kurunthurmalai and Vedukkunari Malai clearly illustrate this.

In both these incidents, the DoA is accused of using its Antiquities Ordinance as a tool, not for conservation, but to prove and solidify a historical Sinhala Buddhist claim over lands and sacred sites traditionally claimed by Tamils, with the support of Buddhist monks and state security forces.

If the current new government of the National People’s Power is genuinely concerned with fostering peace, ethnic reconciliation, and a truly multicultural future, it must take immediate and decisive action to reform the Department of Archaeology.

· Legislative Amendment: The Antiquities Ordinance and related laws must be amended to remove the Department from the direct control of the Minister of Buddhasasana and place it under a neutral ministry (e.g., Higher Education or Science/Technology) to ensure its complete impartiality.

· Institutional Restructuring: The DoA must be restructured with a mandate for diversity, ensuring its senior leadership and committees are composed of qualified experts from all ethnic and religious communities in Sri Lanka.

· Cessation of Political Prosecutions: The immediate cessation of arrests and prosecutions of Tamil citizens who protest against the DoA erecting signboards or land grabbing in their areas is required. These protests should be viewed not as acts of damaging state property, but as reactions to the structural genocide carried out against the Tamil people in the past. The Cabinet Spokesperson’s comments regarding the removal of the DoA signboard show he forgets that this situation would not have occurred if the law had treated all people equally in the first place.

· Conflict Resolution: An independent, multi-ethnic justice framework must be established to review and arbitrate all outstanding archaeological disputes in the North and East based on rigorous, non-politicized scientific methods, while respecting the customary religious rights of existing local communities.

Reforming the Department of Archaeology is not merely an administrative task; it is a critical component of transitional justice. When historical bias prevails, the state ensures the continuation of conflict in the present by consistently weaponizing the past. To establish a genuine and lasting peace in Sri Lanka, the structural genocide carried out against Tamils through the Department of Archaeology must first be stopped.
