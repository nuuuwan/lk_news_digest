Customs says can release vehicles held over LC issues under conditions

Sri Lanka Customs informed the Court of Appeal yesterday that vehicles detained for being imported from countries not listed in the relevant Letters of Credit (LCs) may be released subject to specific conditions.

Appearing for the Department, Additional Solicitor General Sumathi Dharmawardena said importers could recover their vehicles upon submitting a corporate or personal bond and paying any additional fees owed to Customs. The Court was also told that registration would be permitted once all dues are settled.

The announcement was made during the hearing of about 15 fundamental rights petitions filed by vehicle importers seeking release of their shipments. The petitions were taken up before Court of Appeal President Justice Rohantha Abeysuriya and Justice Priyantha Fernando.

Counsel for the petitioners Faiszer Musthapha, PC, argued that similar vehicles had previously been cleared by Customs and urged the Court to call for a list of such cases. He also contended that if the petitioners succeed, the 35% surcharge imposed on the vehicles should be refunded.

Presidentâ€™s Counsels Ikram Mohamed and Sanjeeva Jayawardena, representing other petitioners, requested more time to discuss a possible settlement. The Court ordered the matter to be taken up again on 22 October to explore that option.
