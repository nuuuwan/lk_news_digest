Female-led biz service provider invests over Rs 300 million in three premium venues in Colombo

GrandSpace, a leading strategic experience centre and business services provider, has invested over Rs. 300 million to establish three premium venues in Colombo, underscoring its confidence in Sri Lanka’s corporate sector and commitment to enabling business growth.

GrandSpace also stands out as a female-led enterprise, with 95% of its management and ownership comprising women—a deliberate commitment that recognizes women’s strengths in client service, operations and leadership.

Founder Director Samila Maddumage recalled that the first project at The Astoria was inaugurated in 2020, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.

“Our main aim was to help small start-ups move to the next level by offering affordable workspace solutions that meet international standards. Today, we are proud to see that several of our early clients have established their own offices and built global partnerships, he said.

“Launching the Astoria centre during the global pandemic was challenging, but we remained steadfast and never ceased operations.

Emerging from that difficult period, which impacted businesses worldwide, we not only persevered but expanded to multiple centres, he said.

During the pandemic and subsequent energy crises, the company ensured uninterrupted service by maintaining backup power and fuel supplies, even keeping operations running for overseas clients at its Colombo 06 centre.

The company’s vision extends beyond workspace management. “We provide an all-inclusive experience that supports businesses at every stage—from startups needing virtual offices and company registration to established companies undergoing rapid expansion, Maddumage explained.

“Through our partners, we offer legal, financial, secretarial, concierge, and event-planning services so clients can focus on their core business while we handle the rest, he added.

The company recently marked the fifth anniversary of its Astoria Complex centre, celebrating eight years of operations and continued expansion despite unprecedented challenges. A defining feature of GrandSpace is its ability to support 24-hour operations when required.

Director Nimhani Weerasekera, a chartered architect by profession, said, “The pandemic tested us profoundly, but it also highlighted our team’s resilience and the strength of our service model.”

GrandSpace’s Experience Centres deliver a fully integrated office ecosystem, consolidating utilities, internet, cleaning, refreshments and other operational needs under a single vendor.

“Unlike traditional co-working spaces, its model emphasizes long-term, sustainable workspace solutions designed to relieve clients of management burdens and support business scalability, she said.

Today, GrandSpace’s expansion includes the Astoria Centre (2020), the Crescat Boulevard Centre (2023) and its newest facility at the Vallibel Finance Corporate Head Office building (2025).

“GrandSpace plans to further expand its footprint across Sri Lanka to help more Startups to move up, she said.
