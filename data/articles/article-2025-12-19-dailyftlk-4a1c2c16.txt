NDB Leasing hosts successful two-day auto carnival

NDB Bank has recently concluded another edition of the NDB Leasing Auto Carnival Promotion, held at the Nawam Mawatha car park. The two-day event, organised under the Bank’s dynamic NDB Leasing portfolio, brought together two leading automotive partners Prime EV Automobiles Ltd., Deepal and Gavinro International Ltd., Skywell showcasing a wide selection of modern and eco-friendly vehicles to customers and enthusiasts alike.

The event, which attracted strong interest from the public, served as a vibrant platform for prospective vehicle owners to explore innovative leasing solutions offered by NDB. Visitors were able to experience firsthand a diverse range of vehicles, from fully electric models to versatile commercial options, while engaging directly with NDB’s dedicated leasing officers to learn about the Bank’s flexible financing options.

NDB Bank Assistant Vice President Leasing Dilum Amarasinghe stated, “Our Auto Carnival series reflects NDB’s commitment to bringing customers closer to the latest in automotive innovation while making vehicle ownership more accessible and affordable. Through collaborations with leading partners such as Prime EV Automobiles and Gavinro International, we continue to deliver tailored financial solutions that meet the evolving mobility needs of Sri Lankans.”

The NDB Leasing Auto Carnival is part of a series of on-ground activations conducted by the Bank to enhance customer engagement and accessibility. These events not only highlight NDB’s extensive range of leasing solutions, featuring quick approvals, flexible repayment plans, and minimal documentation, but also strengthen the Bank’s partnerships within Sri Lanka’s rapidly transforming automobile sector.

With the success of the latest Auto Carnival, NDB Leasing looks forward to continuing this series across the island, offering more opportunities for customers to experience trusted partnerships and exceptional service.
