An interim report outlining proposals to establish a formal and scientific salary structure for the public service will be submitted to the Ministerial Consultative Committee on Public Administration, Provincial Councils and Local Government Affairs.

The move comes following a meeting held under the Sub-Committee Chairmanship, MP Chandana Suriyaarachchi this week.

He said the Sub-Committee was appointed by the Ministerial Consultative Committee to review the entire public service, formulate a formal salary framework and elevate professionalism.

MP Suriyaarachchi stated that the Sub-Committee had held extensive discussions with a wide range of stakeholders to understand existing issues in the public service, including salary anomalies and disparities across different categories of employees. Through these engagements, the committee was able to gain a comprehensive picture of the challenges currently faced by public officers.

He noted that the interim report contains the proposals and ideas gathered through this consultative process and aims to lay the foundation for a more systematic, scientific and equitable salary structure applicable to the entire public service. The proposals also cover reforms to service regulations, recruitment procedures, promotions and allowances, with the broader objective of enhancing professionalism across all sectors of the public service.

The Chairman confirmed that the interim report will be formally submitted to the Ministerial Consultative Committee on Public Administration, Provincial Councils, and Local Government Affairs for further consideration and necessary action.
