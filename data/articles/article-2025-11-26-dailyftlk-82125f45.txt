Govt. weighs curbs on rice imports to lift paddy production

The Government is considering stricter limits on rice imports and a more formalised system for purchasing domestic rice as part of an effort to raise paddy production, stabilise prices and strengthen farmer protection.

The proposals were discussed at a meeting held this morning at the Presidential Secretariat, where officials reviewed long-standing problems facing paddy growers and began work on a structured plan to address them.

The session was co-chaired by Agriculture, Livestock, Land and Irrigation Minister K.D. Lalkantha and Trade, Commerce, Food Security and Cooperative Development Minister Wasantha Samarasinghe.

Lalkantha said that while various programmes to assist paddy farmers had been in place for years, comparable mechanisms were lacking for other crops. He said the administration intends to support all farmers through consistent policies and called for farmers, officials and political leaders to act collectively instead of operating in silos.

Participants also examined fertiliser subsidy prices in relation to global trends, the need to maintain a fixed purchasing price for paddy to prevent unfair practices, and the upgrading of essential facilities such as storage and drying. Officials were directed to provide district-level cost-of-production data before new pricing decisions are finalised, which will shape upcoming guaranteed price policies.

The meeting further noted that although seed paddy, fertiliser support and other assistance have been provided, state agencies still face shortages of vehicles, equipment and staff. Filling vacancies in key areas was identified as an urgent requirement.

Farmers present at the meeting welcomed the government’s move toward a more structured approach and said they were prepared to work with authorities to develop durable solutions.
