Cargills ‘Heart for the Nation’ program supports flood-affected communities

Cargills has once again extended its support to the people of Sri Lanka in a time of national hardship, stepping forward to assist families affected by the recent floods through its Heart for the Nation program.

As an immediate relief measure, Cargills has dispatched 10,000 dry-ration packs to the most severely impacted areas, ensuring that essential supplies reach the families who need them most. All distributions are being carried out in close coordination with government agencies and local authorities to ensure delivery to the hardest-hit communities.

Building on this initial effort, Cargills will soon open the initiative to its customers, giving the public the opportunity to join this worthy cause. Through this program, customers will be able to contribute towards the provision of essential food and hygiene items, which Cargills will distribute on behalf of the customer, using its extensive island-wide store network and logistics capabilities. This next phase aims to broaden the reach of relief efforts and bring hope to even more families during this critical period.
