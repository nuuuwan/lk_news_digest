New Anthoney’s Farms invests further LKR 500M in its value-added product range

New Anthoney’s Group, a leading sustainable poultry producer in Sri Lanka renowned for its pioneering antibiotic-free HarithaHari chicken range, has announced a landmark LKR 500 million additional investment to expand its value-added product range, alongside the official launch of its premium product line, Chicken Havens.

The expansion, aimed at quadrupling production capacity within six months, represents a transformative moment for Sri Lanka’s poultry industry. Currently, value-added products constitute approximately 10% of New Anthoney’s total output, with the new investment set to position the company as the country’s leading supplier of chef-grade value-added chicken products to both the HORECA sector and retail market.

The expanded facilities incorporate cutting-edge European technology and adhering to internationally recognized food safety protocols, eco-friendly measures including water treatment plants, and the capacity to produce up to four times (4x) the current volume of value-added products to meet evolving consumer and industry preferences.

“At New Anthoney’s, we believe meat should be honest — rich in taste, true to its source, and crafted with integrity. Our philosophy goes beyond profit, it’s about bringing consumers genuine, high-quality meat they can trust. Every product we create reflects our commitment to innovation, sustainability, and authenticity, ensuring that what reaches your table is pure, flavourful, and responsibly produced,” said Priyanka Vinodini, Head/Business Manager – Further Processing at New Anthoney’s Farms (Pvt) Ltd.

This expansion follows the company’s impressive track record of innovation, including its pioneering Crizzpys Frozen Crispy Chicken, the first of its kind in Sri Lanka, and unique creations like Frenchys Chicken Fries.

The Chicken Havens range comprises eight carefully engineered product categories designed to address critical pain points for professional kitchens and busy households alike. The lineup includes Chicken Ham, Chicken Bacon, Chicken Spicy Roll, Chicken Meat Balls, Chicken Kebab, Chicken Satay, Chicken Burger Patties, and a comprehensive Marinated Range featuring Marinated Roast Chicken.

The new range directly addresses long-standing challenges faced by hotels, restaurants, and catering operations. Inconsistent cuts, unpredictable yields, excessive preparation time, and food safety concerns have plagued professional kitchens for years. Chicken Havens standardized processing lines deliver repeatable outcomes, pre-portioned products reduce waste, and internationally recognized food safety systems minimize risk.

While Chicken Havens was developed with professional chefs in mind, the range will soon be available in retail outlets, bringing restaurant-quality protein to home kitchens. The products feature meat-rich recipes with clear protein content, chef-tested seasonings, ready-to-cook convenience, and consistent portion sizes that guarantee repeatable results regardless of cooking skill level. “People want restaurant flavors at home. For households, the promise is safe, reliable protein and real convenience. Meat rich recipes mean better texture and taste with far less prep,” added Priyanka.
