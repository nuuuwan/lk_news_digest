Bangladesh delivers essential aid to Sri Lanka

Bangladesh dispatched a humanitarian relief consignment to Sri Lanka yesterday afternoon to support ongoing recovery efforts following the devastation caused by the recent adverse weather conditions.

The shipment of relief arrived aboard a Bangladesh Air Force C-130 aircraft and was formally handed over by Bangladeshi High Commissioner Andalib Elias. The cargo included 1,000 mosquito nets, 500 food packets, 10 tents, and 20 pieces each of torch lights, gum boots, vests, gloves, and hats, along with 125 boxes of essential medicines.

The assistance will be immediately directed to affected communities, further strengthening relief operations in the affected regions, the President’s Media Division said.
