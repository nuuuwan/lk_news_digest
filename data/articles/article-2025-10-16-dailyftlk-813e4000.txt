Virtusa expands technology centre in Sri Lanka with over 200 open roles

Virtusa Corporation has announced the expansion of its Sri Lanka Delivery Centre with over 200 new career opportunities across high-growth technology domains. The initiative marks a renewed phase of investment in the country as Virtusa accelerates its journey toward becoming a $ 5 billion enterprise by 2030.

The expansion follows the strategic vision outlined by Virtusa CEO Nitesh Banga, who has committed to positioning the company as the world’s leading domain-driven engineering partner for the AI-enterprise. During his recent official visit to Sri Lanka as CEO, Banga emphasised the country’s integral role in Virtusa’s global delivery network and its heritage as the firm’s founding centre of excellence.

The 200-plus open positions announced by Virtusa span Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data Science, Full Stack Development, BPO/KPO services and DevOps roles, reflecting Virtusa’s focus on scaling its engineering and AI capabilities to support clients across banking, financial services, healthcare, insurance, telecom, and technology industries. These roles include both entry-level and experienced positions and offer Sri Lankan professionals the opportunity to contribute to cutting-edge AI and digital transformation projects for Fortune 500 clients worldwide.

Virtusa’s Sri Lanka operations have long been a core component of the company’s global delivery model, combining deep domain fluency with agile engineering and a culture of continuous innovation. The Colombo centre plays a key role in advancing Virtusa Helio, the company’s suite of AI-powered accelerators that help enterprises drive measurable business outcomes and faster time-to-value from their AI investments.

“Sri Lanka continues to be a strategic centre of excellence for Virtusa. Our current recruitment drive reflects our confidence in the country’s high-quality talent and the potential of this market to deliver world-class engineering and AI solutions to global clients,” said Virtusa Corporation Chief Operating Officer Venkatesan Vijayaraghavan.

In line with Virtusa’s focus on AI and GenAI-led innovation, the company continues to invest in upskilling its employees through its Virtusa Thrive Academy, with programs in AI orchestration, prompt engineering, and domain-specific applications. These initiatives strengthen Virtusa’s position as a future-ready employer and a catalyst for the growth of Sri Lanka’s digital economy.

The ongoing recruitment effort underscores Virtusa’s long-term commitment to building global careers for Sri Lankan professionals while fuelling the next chapter of its growth story from Colombo.

Sri Lanka has always been central to Virtusa’s success story. As we advance toward our vision of becoming a $ 5 billion enterprise by 2030, our focus remains on nurturing world-class Sri Lankan talent capable of leading in an AI-first world,” commented Virtusa Corporation Joint Country Head (Sri Lanka) Denver De Zylva.
