India deploys INS Vikrant helicopters for Sri Lanka’s cyclone relief efforts

India yesterday deployed helicopters from the aircraft carrier INS Vikrant docked in Colombo, to support Sri Lanka’s rescue and relief operations as Cyclonic Storm Ditwah continues to generate severe weather across the island.

Defence Ministry Secretary Air Vice Marshal Sampath Thuyacontha said the Government formally requested assistance from the Indian warship, including the use of its aircraft, to reinforce ongoing humanitarian efforts.

The request was submitted to the Indian High Commission in Colombo earlier in the day, he said during a special media briefing.

Thuyacontha cautioned that the same adverse weather conditions affecting Sri Lanka are also impacting flight operations of the Indian aircraft. As a result, deployment may be limited depending on the intensity of the storm and prevailing safety conditions.

The Government is continuing evacuation, rescue and relief measures across multiple districts as rains, gale-force winds and rising floodwaters persist.

Indian naval vessels INS Vikrant and INS Udaygiri also donated materials to aid the ongoing weather crisis relief.
