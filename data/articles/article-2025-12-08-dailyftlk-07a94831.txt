The American Chamber of Commerce in Sri Lanka (AmCham SL), in partnership with Wijeya Newspapers Ltd., has announced a strategic forum titled, “Narrating Sri Lanka’s Story: How Strategic Communications Can Fuel Investment, Talent and Global Partnerships.” The event will take place on 15 December 2025, from 10:00 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. at the Taj Samudra Colombo, followed by networking and refreshments.

As Sri Lanka works toward sustainable economic stabilisation and future-oriented growth, the need for a unified, credible, and compelling national narrative is more critical than ever. This forum will gather leading voices from global communications, business, investment, and policy to explore how the country can more effectively convey its strengths, ambitions, and opportunities to international audiences. In an era where nations compete not only on economic performance but also on perception, trust, and storytelling, this dialogue offers a timely and important platform.

AmCham SL and Wijeya Newspapers Ltd., will host Curzon PR (UK) CEO and Co-Founder and Chartered Institute of Public Relations (CIPR UK), President-Elect Farzana Baduel as the keynote speaker.

Her expertise spans soft power, nation branding, global influence, strategic positioning, and purpose-led communications, all areas essential to countries seeking investment, talent, and international partnerships. As an advocate for diversity, social mobility, authenticity, and ethical communication, Farzana’s approach emphasises the importance of genuine and values-driven storytelling. Her insightful writing on Sri Lanka’s resilience, potential, and place in the world brings a uniquely informed and empathetic perspective to this discussion. Her presence underscores the rising global interest in Sri Lanka’s narrative and the opportunities that can be unlocked through consistent, strategic communication.

Attendees can expect practical insights into aligning organisational messaging with national priorities, communicating purpose and credibility, and using storytelling as a competitive advantage.

This forum reinforces AmCham SL’s commitment to fostering meaningful, forward-looking conversations that enhance the country’s global competitiveness. It also highlights a significant collaboration with Wijeya Newspapers Ltd. In today’s interconnected global environment, a nation’s reputation is shaped not only by its progress but also by how effectively it communicates its story, and how the world receives it. For Sri Lanka, mastering this narrative is essential to rebuilding confidence, attracting long-term investment, and projecting itself as a resilient, opportunity-rich, and future-ready nation.

Attendance is open to AmCham members, corporate partners, and the wider business community, including leaders in communications, marketing, public policy, investment, and development. Pre-registration is strongly recommended, as seating will be limited to ensure a dynamic and interactive environment.
