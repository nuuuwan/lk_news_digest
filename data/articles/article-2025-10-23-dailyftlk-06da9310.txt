Weligama PS Chairman’s murder: Four Police teams deployed

Four Police teams have been deployed to investigate the murder of Weligama Pradeshiya Sabha (PS) Chairman Lasantha Wickramasekara (38), who was shot dead yesterday (22) morning, Police Media Spokesman Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) F.U. Wootler said.

At the weekly post-Cabinet meeting media briefing, he said the investigation was being conducted under the direct instructions of the Senior Deputy Inspector General (SDIG) in charge of the Southern Province.

“All available resources have been mobilised, and four teams have commenced inquiries to identify the perpetrators and motives behind this murder,” he said.

The two unidentified gunmen on a motor bike opened fire at Wickramasekara, who was at his office at that time at the Weligama PS premises.

He was taken to the hospital with severe injuries but succumbed to his injuries at the Matara General Hospital.

According to the Police Spokesman, the gunman, who covered his face with a black mask, had entered Wickramasekara’s room pretending to get him to sign a letter. “The gunmen had used four bullets and the Police have confirmed that a pistol was used to shoot the PS Chairman,” Wootler said. (SS)
