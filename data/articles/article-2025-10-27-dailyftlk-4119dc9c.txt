Three arrested over Weligama PS Chairman killing

The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) yesterday arrested three suspects, including a woman, in connection with the killing of Weligama Pradeshiya Sabha Chairman Lasantha Wickramasekera.

Police said the arrests were made during an operation in the Kekirawa area as part of the ongoing investigation into the incident. The suspects are to be handed over to the Weligama Police for further questioning.

Wickramasekera was shot dead on Wednesday (22) inside his office at the Weligama Pradeshiya Sabha premises by an unidentified gunman. The assailant, wearing a white shirt and a black face mask, had entered the office pretending to sign a document before opening fire.

CCTV footage showed the gunman firing four rounds at the chairman, who was seated at his desk, before escaping on a motorcycle with another individual. Wickramasekera sustained critical head, chest, and abdominal injuries and died later at the Matara General Hospital.

The investigation is being conducted to identify others involved and establish the motive behind the murder.
