Regen Renewables completes 450 kW solar power project across 47 sites for Colombo District Secretariat

Regen Renewables Ltd., has successfully completed a 450 kW solar power initiative implemented across 47 community, religious, educational, and public service institutions. Awarded through a competitive tender process, this project represents a significant advancement in strengthening clean energy integration within Sri Lanka’s public sector and community infrastructure.

The initiative forms part of a broader Government effort to accelerate renewable energy adoption, reduce dependency on conventional power sources, and lower long-term operational costs across public and community-based establishments. As the selected implementation partner, Regen Renewables Ltd., was responsible for the full scope of work, including the design, supply, installation, and commissioning of solar PV systems across all 47 locations within Colombo District.

These sites span a wide range of institutions including Vidyodaya Maha Pirivena, Jumma Masjid in Kirulapana, Lankadhara Girls Child Development Centre, Prince of Wales College, Cooperative Limited Society, Kolonnawa Purana Rajamaha Viharaya, Anula Vidyalaya, Philip Gunawardhane Ground, Meegoda Ayurveda Hospital, Seethawaka District Secretariat, St. Joseph’s Church in Gangodawila, Victoria Home, and several others.

Collectively, the systems generate approximately 594,000 kWh of clean electricity annually, contributing to a reduction of 445 metric tons of CO₂ emissions and offsetting electricity costs valued at Rs. 37.15 million per year. This project not only enhances energy efficiency but also delivers long-term environmental and economic benefits for the communities and institutions involved.

Regen Renewables Managing Director and CEO Dr. Lakmal Fernando said, “Regen Renewables is proud to partner with the Colombo District Secretariat in advancing Sri Lanka’s transition to clean energy. Completing this project across 47 diverse institutions demonstrates our commitment to delivering sustainable, high-impact solutions that benefit both the environment and the communities we serve.”

This initiative directly contributes to Sri Lanka’s updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) by accelerating the country’s shift toward renewable energy, significantly lowering carbon emissions, and reducing the nation’s reliance on fossil-fuel-based power generation. By embedding solar infrastructure across community and public-sector institutions, the project strengthens Sri Lanka’s long-term climate resilience, supports national sustainability targets, and reinforces the country’s commitment to building a cleaner, more energy-secure future for generations to come.
