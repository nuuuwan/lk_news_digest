Japanese business delegation visits National Chamber of Commerce of Sri Lanka

The National Chamber of Commerce of Sri Lanka (NCCSL) has hosted a Japanese business delegation, headed by Leader of the Delegation Akashi Yasuo, on 12 December 2025, for a focused discussion aimed at strengthening bilateral economic cooperation, particularly in key development sectors.

The delegation featured senior representatives from several Japanese industries, including construction, ceramics, apparel, and large-scale manufacturing (petroleum-related vehicles and tanks). The visit underscored the interest from Japan’s corporate sector, with several delegates exploring immediate investment opportunities and strategic partnerships with local Sri Lankan enterprises.

To maximise the potential for successful deals, NCCSL convened an exclusive B2B session. This facilitated direct dialogue and networking between the Japanese delegation and participants. The presence of the President of the National Chamber, Executive Committee and the council members assured high-level engagement with the delegates and reinforced the Chamber’s commitment to the emerging partnerships.

Discussions focused on identifying potential avenues for joint ventures, technology transfer, and long-term collaborations. These partnerships are strategically aligned with Sri Lanka’s national development priorities, specifically targeting high-end tourism infrastructure and advanced manufacturing.

The NCCSL reaffirms its commitment to serving as the foremost platform connecting Sri Lankan businesses with credible global partners, driving international trade linkages, and facilitating essential foreign investment.
