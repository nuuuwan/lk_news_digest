President attends Sri Lanka Navy passing-out parade

President Anura Kumara Dissanayake on Saturday attended the commissioning and passing-out parade of the Sri Lanka Navy at the Trincomalee Naval and Maritime Academy.

Dissanayake paid heartfelt tribute to the Sri Lanka Navy for its immense contribution during the Ditwah disaster, particularly commending its courageous rescue operations at the Kala Oya, where naval personnel risked their own lives to give hope to those trapped by fear of death and saved a large number of lives. He expressed deep gratitude for the Navy’s selfless service and honoured the naval personnel who made the supreme sacrifice while rescuing others.

Upon his arrival at the Trincomalee Naval and Maritime Academy, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces Dissanayake was received with full naval honours.

At the ceremony, eight directly commissioned officers of intake 2024/03, 33 officers of the 40th intake of the General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University, and 2 officers of the 65th cadet intake of the Trincomalee Naval and Maritime Academy were commissioned.

Awards were presented to senior sailors who demonstrated outstanding performance during training and ceremonial swords were presented to the newly commissioned officers by the President.

The President also commended the Sri Lanka Navy for its vital role in combatting the drug menace, which he described as one of the greatest challenges facing the country today. He reaffirmed the Government’s firm commitment to take every necessary measure to protect the nation from drug trafficking and called upon all citizens to unite in safeguarding the motherland from this threat.

Emphasising the importance of responsibility and duty, President Dissanayake stated that although he himself as the President, the Commander of the Navy, and all other officers bear different responsibilities according to their positions, each responsibility is equally vital for a stable and strong State.

The President stressed that the nation can move forward only when everyone faithfully discharges the duties entrusted to them and that no profession or responsibility should be regarded as secondary, as each contributes to nation-building.

Expressing appreciation to those who chose to join the Sri Lanka Navy, an institution known for its discipline, courage, and honour, the President urged the newly commissioned officers to carry out the responsibilities placed upon their shoulders with dedication from today onward. He extended his best wishes to all officers for a successful and distinguished professional career.

The event was attended by Eastern Province Governor Jayantha Lal Ratnasekera, Deputy Defence Minister Major General (Retd.) Aruna Jayasekara, Defence Secretary Air Vice Marshal Sampath (Retd.) Thuyacontha, Army Commander Lieutenant General Lasantha Rodrigo, Navy Commander Vice Admiral Kanchana Banagoda, Air Force Commander Air Marshal Vasu Bandu Edirisinghe, Inspector General of Police Attorney Priyantha Weerasooriya, senior officers of the Navy, and the parents of the newly commissioned officers participated in this event.
