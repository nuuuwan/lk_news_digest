UNICEF’s ‘Little Amaya – See Me, Hear Me’ exhibit opens at Lotus Tower

Four-day exhibit a celebration of children’s voices through art and technology

Sri Lanka yesterday marked World Children’s Day and the anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child with the official opening of ‘Little Amaya – See Me, Hear Me,’ an immersive, interactive child rights experience and art exhibition at the Lotus Tower.

The initiative, led by the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) Sri Lanka, together with the Department of Probation and Child Care Services (DPCCS) and the National Child Protection Authority (NCPA), was launched in the presence of UNICEF Sri Lanka Representative Emma Brigham and senior officials from the Women and Child Affairs Ministry (MoWCA), DPCCS, and NCPA.

Designed to bring child rights to life in a way that is playful, accessible, and relatable, the exhibit at Lotus Tower’s Pixel Bloom blends storytelling, movement, and game-based learning through the character of Little Amaya – a child who guides visitors through an imaginative world where every right is felt, seen, and experienced. The space allows children to explore themes such as protection, participation, and expression using hands-on interactive technology that encourages curiosity and dialogue.

Complementing this experience is a vibrant art exhibition featuring over 200 self-portraits and creative pieces co-created by children from across Sri Lanka – from urban centres to rural estates, from diverse cultural, linguistic, and socio-economic backgrounds. The artwork emerged from workshops facilitated around the country, giving children the space and tools to express who they are, how they see themselves, and what matters to them.

Brigham underscored the significance of listening to children and creating spaces where their perspectives matter. “Participation is a right and when we listen to children, we make better decisions,” she said adding the exhibit is a reminder that children are not just recipients of services or protection; they are thinkers, creators, and partners in shaping the world around them.

Officials from the NCPA, DPCCS, and MoWCA commended the initiative as a timely platform that promotes awareness of child rights among families, educators, and the broader public, while also celebrating the power of children’s imagination and their ability to articulate their hopes and concerns.

‘Little Amaya – See Me, Hear Me’ will remain open until 24 November at the Pixel Bloom Lotus Tower from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. UNICEF and its partners warmly invite families, teachers, youth groups, and all Sri Lankans to visit the exhibit, experience the interactive journey, and witness the extraordinary creativity of children across the country.
