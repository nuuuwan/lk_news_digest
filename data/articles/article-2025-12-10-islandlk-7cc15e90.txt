Anti-ageing home remedies

Hi! Yes, we are all experiencing a sad scene in our beloved country, with Cylone Ditwah creating all the havoc.

However, if you do have the time, and your mind is kind of relax now, why not try out the following:

Brew a cup of green tea and let it cool completely. Use it as a toner by applying it to your face with a cotton pad. Use daily for a refreshing boost that keeps your skin youthful and clear.

For added benefits, repurpose used green tea bags as a cool compress for tired or puffy eyes.

(Green tea, they say, is loaded with catechins and antioxidants that combat free radicals, reduce inflammation, and help slow down skin ageing. It’s a refreshing at-home anti-ageing treatment that revitalises the skin.)

Mash a ripe papaya into a fine paste and apply it to your face and let it sit for 15-20 minutes. Rinse off with lukewarm water.

Use it 02-03 times a week to reveal smoother, more radiant skin.

For an extra boost, mix papaya paste with a few drops of lemon juice, but exercise caution if you have sensitive skin.

(Papaya contains the enzyme papain and powerful antioxidants that gently exfoliate dead skin cells, brighten the complexion, and reduce fine lines, making it a highly effective anti-ageing home remedy.)

Massage a small amount of extra virgin olive oil onto your clean face and leave it on overnight to allow deep absorption.

For an enhanced skin-soothing effect, mix olive oil with a few drops of essential oil (like lavender) before application.

(Olive oil is rich in antioxidants, vitamins, and healthy fats, making it a superb at-home anti- ageing treatment. It deeply nourishes the skin, improves elasticity, and reduces the appearance of fine lines.)

Mash half an avocado to create a smooth paste and apply it as a mask on your face and leave it on for 15-20 minutes before rinsing.

Use it 02-03 times a week for a consistent boost of hydration and nourishment.

For added hydration, mix the avocado paste with a teaspoon of honey or yoghurt.

(Avocado is a nutrient-dense natural remedy for anti-ageing. It provides essential fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals that deeply moisturise, boost elasticity, and help diminish wrinkles.)
