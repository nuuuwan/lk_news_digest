High Court told Daisy Forrest unable to face money laundering trial due to dementia

Defense counsel appearing for Daisy Forrest, grandmother of Yoshitha Rajapaksa, told the Colombo High Court yesterday, proceedings against her under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act are unfounded, citing her advanced age and serious mental health condition

During a hearing before Judge Udesh Ranatunga, President’s Counsel Anil Silva submitted that his 98-year-old client suffers from dementia and Alzheimer’s disease, rendering her unable to comprehend or participate in the ongoing trial.

Silva emphasised that Forrest’s condition prevents her from managing even her personal affairs independently. He argued that, given her mental incapacity, she cannot understand the nature of the alleged offences or respond meaningfully to the charges.

The Counsel urged the Court to consider the lack of legal foundation for maintaining the indictment, highlighting the humanitarian and legal implications of proceeding against an individual in such a vulnerable state.

The matter is expected to be addressed further by the court as it considers Forrest’s capacity to stand trial.
