Aberdeen Holdings’ Snehadhana Foundation expands its outreach with the launch of the School Meal Support Project

Child malnutrition remains one of Sri Lanka’s most pressing social challenges, one that hinders not only children’s physical health but also their ability to learn, grow, and dream. With a strong sense of purpose, Aberdeen Holdings’ Snehadhana Foundation, together with its group member Tropikal Life International, continues to drive sustainable solutions through the School Meal Support Project, the latest of which was launched at Ng/Bandaranayaka Vidyalaya.

The initiative, inaugurated on 1st October 2025, symbolically on World Children’s Day, will provide daily meals for over 100 schoolchildren. Beyond supplying food, the project brings together a structured system, where Snehadhana Foundation and Tropikal Life, fund, coordinate, and monitor every aspect, from sourcing weekly groceries and kitchen supplies to ensuring safe storage, hygiene, and consistent meal preparation. The programme empowers the school community by engaging parents as volunteers, creating a shared sense of ownership and collective care.

At the inauguration, Mrs. H.T.I.M. Peiris, Principal of Bandaranayaka Vidyalaya, spoke of the struggles faced by many children who arrive at school without a proper meal, describing nutrition as “not a privilege, but a necessity that shapes a child’s ability to learn and succeed.”

The School Meal Support Project builds on the success of its first phase at Heiyanthuduwa Mahinda Vidyalaya, initiated in January 2023, which has been operating successfully for more than two years. Each school week, an average of 400 meals are provided to students, an effort made possible through the unwavering collaboration between Snehadhana Foundation, Tropikal Life, school staff, and parents. The project’s impact has been deeply felt, with teachers and parents expressing gratitude for the consistent meals and the positive change in students’ focus, attendance, and overall wellbeing.
