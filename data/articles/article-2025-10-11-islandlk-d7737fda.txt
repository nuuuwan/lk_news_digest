Sri Lanka’s Battle Against Tobacco: Progress, Setbacks, and the Road Ahead

Tobacco remains one of Sri Lanka’s deadliest public health challenges, claiming an estimated 20,000 lives every year. Despite decades of progress and the nation’s pioneering role in global tobacco control, experts warn that momentum has slowed and urgent action is needed to protect future generations. With the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), Sri Lanka stands at a crossroads: will it renew its leadership in the global fight against tobacco, or allow industry interference and policy inertia to erode hard-won gains? This area should be of utmost importance to the Health Minister of the current Sri Lankan government as a policymaker.

According to the 2020 Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS), tobacco use remains alarmingly high in Sri Lanka. Over one-third of men (36.2%) and nearly five percent of women use tobacco in some form. While cigarette smoking is the most visible form of use, smokeless tobacco remains a stubborn problem, particularly among rural and low-income communities.

The numbers translate into devastating human and economic costs. Each year, tobacco-related diseases such as cancer, heart disease, stroke, lung disease, and diabetes take the lives of tens of thousands of Sri Lankans. Treatment of tobacco-related cancers alone costs the public health system an estimated Rs. 5.6 billion annually.

The indirect costs are equally staggering. Families bear the brunt of lost income when breadwinners fall ill or die prematurely. Household expenditure on tobacco often displaces spending on food, education, and healthcare, deepening cycles of poverty.

Beyond active smokers, millions of Sri Lankans remain exposed to second-hand smoke. GATS data revealed that 16.7% of adults working indoors are regularly exposed to smoke at their workplaces, while 8.4% are exposed inside their homes. Alarmingly, 25.2% reported exposure when visiting restaurants.

Exposure to second-hand smoke causes serious illness. More than 94% of Sri Lankan adults recognize this danger, yet enforcement of smoke-free laws remains patchy. Smoking is banned in many indoor public places and workplaces, but loopholes allow designated smoking areas in hotels, restaurants, and airports. Beaches, parks, and roads are not covered by the ban, leaving large segments of the population vulnerable.

Tobacco is not just a health issue—it is an economic one. The average Sri Lankan smoker spends over Rs. 5,400 monthly on manufactured cigarettes, a significant burden in a country where household budgets are already stretched.

While cigarette prices are high compared to regional standards, they remain affordable relative to income levels. Public health experts argue that tax hikes—paired with a simplified tax structure—could reduce consumption while raising government revenue. According to WHO-FCTC estimates, every rupee spent on administering cigarette taxes yields Rs. 724 in long-term returns.

Yet the tobacco industry continues to position itself as a revenue contributor rather than the cause of crippling healthcare costs and lost productivity. Critics note that Sri Lanka still loses over Rs. 213 billion annually in direct and indirect costs tied to tobacco use.

Sri Lanka ratified the FCTC in 2003, becoming the first Asian country and the fourth globally to do so. Under the stewardship of the late Professor Carlo Fonseka, the country introduced strong laws through the National Authority on Tobacco and Alcohol Act (NATA) of 2006. His tenure from 2006 to 2015 is widely remembered as the “Golden Era” of tobacco control.

During that period, Sri Lanka banned most forms of tobacco advertising, mandated pictorial health warnings covering 80% of cigarette packaging, and prohibited the sale of cigarettes to minors. In 2015, Parliament strengthened regulations, requiring graphic warnings on both sides of cigarette packs.

But in recent years, the pace of progress has slowed. Court challenges by the tobacco industry temporarily weakened health warning requirements. Enforcement gaps persist in smoke-free laws. Meanwhile, new threats have emerged, such as the rise of e-cigarettes, particularly among international school children. While sales of e-cigarettes are technically prohibited, their use and promotion remain largely unregulated.

Experts argue that Sri Lanka has a roadmap for renewed progress—it simply needs the political will to act. Key recommendations include:

· Expand smoke-free laws to cover all public spaces, including beaches and parks.

· Ban individual cigarette sales, which make smoking accessible to youth and the poor.

If implemented, these measures could save thousands of lives annually while reducing economic losses from healthcare costs and lost productivity.

Civil society plays a crucial role in holding governments accountable to FCTC commitments. Shadow reporting is an independent assessment submitted alongside government reports, has emerged as a powerful tool. According to the 2025 FCTC Shadow Reporting outreach strategy, NGOs are encouraged to meet with officials before and after COP11, align findings with the provisional agenda, and ensure governments commit to evidence-based policies.

Publicity is equally important. Experts recommend national press conferences, media interviews, and commentaries to raise awareness. Involving celebrities or trusted figures can amplify reach, particularly among youth. Key messages were included:

· Progress slowed during COVID-19, and renewed momentum is essential.

· The FCTC remains the world’s only public health treaty, credited with saving millions of lives.

· Tobacco use still kills over eight million people globally every year.

· Tobacco control is a “best buy” for public health, producing enormous dividends in health and productivity.

Perhaps the most pressing challenge is countering tobacco industry interference. From legal challenges to aggressive marketing of new products, the industry has repeatedly undermined Sri Lanka’s public health policies. Experts argue for stricter enforcement of Article 5.3 of the FCTC, which requires governments to protect policymaking from industry influence. Transparency in interactions with the tobacco industry, robust conflict-of-interest rules, and vigilant monitoring are essential to ensure public health, not profits, drives national policy.

Sri Lanka’s tobacco epidemic is at a critical juncture. The data is clear: tobacco continues to kill, impoverish, and burden the nation’s healthcare system. Yet the solutions are equally clear: stronger taxation, comprehensive bans, plain packaging, and aggressive enforcement. The question is whether policymakers will act with urgency. As civil society prepares its shadow reports and advocacy campaigns ahead of COP11, the spotlight is firmly on Sri Lanka’s next moves. If Sri Lanka can restore the spirit of its “Golden Era” of tobacco control, it could reclaim its position as a regional model, with NATA taking the lead as the responsible authority in implementing robust control measures. But if complacency takes hold, the toll of preventable deaths and economic losses will only grow.
