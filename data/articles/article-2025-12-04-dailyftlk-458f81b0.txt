Women’s Chamber calls for urgent support as Cyclone Ditwah floods trigger nationwide crisis

The Women’s Chamber of Industry and Commerce (WCIC) has appealed for immediate assistance to help women-led businesses recover from the widespread destruction caused by Cyclone Ditwah, warning that the unprecedented flooding has disrupted livelihoods across the country and hindered ongoing relief efforts.

As our nation confronts an unprecedented disaster brought on by extreme weather, we stand together in solidarity to help restore the lives and livelihoods of all those affected. This is said to be the worst flood Sri Lanka has ever experienced, with the entire country impacted, thousands of homes submerged, and millions of people facing hardship. Saving lives remains the foremost priority, and the nation has mobilised swiftly. However, ongoing high water levels continue to hinder relief efforts and restrict access to certain areas.

As the national chamber for women in business, we appeal to you to connect with us, extend your support, and help us establish a dedicated fund to assist our members and other women entrepreneurs whose businesses have been severely affected. We will create a robust methodology to support with available resources.
