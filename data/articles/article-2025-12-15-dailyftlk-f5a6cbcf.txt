AKD visits Mannar and Puttalam to discuss post-Ditwah recovery

President Anura Kumara Dissanayake on Saturday (13) attended a Special District Coordination Committee Meeting held at the Mannar District Secretariat, convened to review ongoing efforts to restore normalcy to public life and rehabilitate infrastructure following the recent disaster.

At the meeting, Dissanayake affirmed that the Government will never allow the violation of the rights of the fishing community, emphasising the State’s firm commitment to protecting both land resources and the coastline.

He said that the Government will address the challenges faced by fishing communities across the country through discussion and constructive engagement, ensuring sustainable solutions while safeguarding livelihoods.

Highlighting the urgent need for a permanent solution to flooding in the Mannar District, the President instructed officials to proceed with the proposed flood control project after conducting comprehensive studies to ensure its long-term effectiveness.

Special attention was drawn to the severe impact of the disaster on the fishing sector. It was revealed that approximately 12,000 fishermen are currently unable to engage in fishing activities due to flooding and adverse weather conditions.

The President directed that dry ration packs be provided for one week to fishing families who, although not directly affected by floods, have lost their livelihoods due to unfavourable weather conditions.

Additionally, discussions were held on engaging with the Chinese Embassy to distribute a stock of fishing gear donated by the Government of China to fishermen affected by the disaster.

Attention was also focused on illegal land encroachments within the water catchment area of the Yodha Wewa Sanctuary. The President instructed that strict legal action be taken against individuals obstructing the placement of boundary markers around the reservoir.

It was reported that 70 families in the Mannar District have lost their homes due to the disaster. Discussions were held on rebuilding these houses and identifying suitable land for resettlement. A committee will be appointed to identify the required land within the next two weeks.

The meeting also addressed the expansion of facilities at Mannar Base Hospital and other hospitals, along with restoring health services and normalising educational activities in the district.

The President further instructed that the Rs. 15,000 assistance provided by the Treasury for schoolchildren be disbursed promptly through Divisional Secretaries, based on recommendations from Grama Niladhari officers.

Extensive discussions were also held on reconstruction of damaged roads and bridges, restoration of water and electricity supply, rehabilitation of irrigation systems, compensation for losses in agriculture and livestock sectors, and supporting affected communities to restart their livelihoods without delay.

At the District Coordinating Committee in Puttalam, the President instructed officials to give top priority to restoring the livelihoods of communities affected by the disaster. He emphasised the need to expedite compensation payments for damages and to take immediate measures to revive the agriculture, fisheries, and industrial sectors.

During the meeting, the rehabilitation of damaged highways and bridges in the district was discussed in detail. Dissanayake inquired into issues arising during these reconstruction efforts and provided on-the-spot solutions in consultation with the relevant officials.

The construction of the Lower Kala Oya Bridge was also discussed. The President instructed that a temporary bridge be built to meet the needs of the tourism sector. He emphasised that all construction activities should be carried out with a thorough understanding of necessity and proper structural assessments.

The President further highlighted that previous large-scale projects were abandoned without delivering tangible benefits or the intended outcomes. He stressed that future infrastructure development should focus not only on regional needs but also on the broader economic benefits for the country as a whole.

The President inquired about the ongoing efforts to restore electricity supply in the district and emphasised the need to complete these works without delay.

He also reviewed measures being taken to re-establish water supply and instructed provincial authorities to intervene promptly, noting that current well-cleaning efforts in the district are insufficient.

Regarding agriculture, the President inquired about preparations by local farmers for the upcoming Maha paddy cultivation. He directed officials to swiftly create a conducive environment for farming, minimise the amount of abandoned land, and explore alternative methods to ensure productive use of farmland.

He instructed that all compensation due to farmers be disbursed before 25 December, that payments be made regardless of whether the land is in reserve or legally protected areas, and that systematic measures be implemented to prevent cultivation on reserved lands.

The President also highlighted the need for comprehensive soil conservation programs in areas such as Kalpitiya.

The President emphasised the need to provide fair compensation to those engaged in the livestock sector in order to restore their livelihoods. He also highlighted the importance of obtaining accurate ground-level data and stressed the necessity of introducing legislation to ensure the registration of all livestock farms.

Due to the disaster, 627 houses in the district were completely destroyed, and 20,813 houses sustained partial damage. The President instructed that compensation for the affected families be expedited, emphasising priority resettlement on Government land. Where Government land is unavailable, he directed that Rs. 5 million be provided to each family for the purchase of alternative land.

For those whose houses were completely destroyed, the President directed that new housing projects be implemented in a manner that ensures ownership of a house valued at Rs. 5 million for each beneficiary.

Attention was also given to the fisheries sector. Discussions were held on providing assistance for the repair of damaged fishing boats, as well as implementing fair compensation and concessional bank loan schemes for prawn farmers.

President Dissanayake also inquired into the operations at Chilaw Hospital. Authorities informed him that patient admissions and the functioning of several units could resume by next week.

The meeting was attended by a distinguished group of officials and representatives, including the Public Administration, Provincial Councils, and Local Government Minister and Chairman of the Puttalam District.
