New Swiss lifeline for heart patients as Karapitiya Hospital receives state-of-the-art medical gift

In a major boost for public healthcare in Southern Sri Lanka, the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital has taken delivery of a state-of-the-art angiography machine, a multi-million-rupee gift from a Swiss Foundation set to dramatically cut waiting times and save countless lives.

The Philips Azurion 3M12 machine, a sophisticated medical imaging system, was donated by the Herz Clinic Foundation of Zurich, Switzerland, and will double the hospital’s capacity to diagnose and treat life-threatening cardiovascular diseases. The donation marks a significant step in addressing the critical burden of heart disease, which disproportionately affects the ordinary people reliant on the state health system.

Karapitiya Hospital, the primary state-run tertiary care centre for the Southern Province, also serves a vast population from the Sabaragamuwa and Uva Provinces. Its existing, overburdened angiography machine has been struggling to keep up with demand, leading to dangerously long waiting lists.

“In Sri Lanka, the burden of cardiovascular diseases is very high. Our hospital faces extremely long waiting times, and our existing machine can no longer meet the growing demand,” explained Dr. Udesh Ranga, Director of Karapitiya Hospital, who is overseeing the installation. “The waiting list extends to patients from two other provinces. This new unit will be transformative and it will help clear this backlog and, most importantly, save lives.”

The project was initiated by Swiss citizens Rudolf Albert Gauhl and Hui Min Dias Bandaranayake through the Heart Clinic Foundation. They highlighted that the donation goes beyond just the hardware.
