CEAT Kelani attains ISO 14064-1:2018 certification for GHG emissions reporting

CEAT Kelani Holdings has received the ISO 14064-1:2018 certification for the quantification and reporting of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and removals, marking a significant milestone in the company’s ongoing commitment to sustainable growth and responsible manufacturing.

The certification was issued following an independent third-party verification conducted by Control Union Inspections (Pvt) Ltd.

As the manufacturer of half of Sri Lanka’s pneumatic tyre requirements, CEAT Kelani’s achievement has significance for the country’s industrial landscape. The certification confirms the company’s adherence to internationally recognised standards for managing climate impact and aligns with Sri Lanka’s national Measurement, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) framework.

CEAT Kelani Chief Operating Officer Shamal Gunawardene said the certification was an endorsement of CEAT Kelani’s commitment to climate responsibility: “This achievement reflects the seriousness with which we integrate environmental stewardship into every aspect of our business,” he said. “From renewable energy investments to sustainable sourcing and operational efficiency, we are taking decisive steps to reduce our carbon footprint in our entire supply chain and contribute meaningfully to Sri Lanka’s climate goals.”

Under ISO 14064-1:2018, CEAT Kelani has quantified and reported its emissions across Scope 1 (direct emissions), Scope 2 (indirect energy emissions), and relevant Scope 3 (value chain) categories, adopting the operational control approach. The validation and verification of the company’s GHG inventory

assessed the completeness, accuracy, transparency, consistency, and relevance of CEAT’s disclosures, and confirmed their compliance with the standard.

The certification is underpinned by CEAT Kelani’s broader sustainability initiatives, including the commissioning of a 2.4 MW solar power plant at its main Kelaniya manufacturing facility. This installation generates 59.61 GWh of electricity over its lifetime, offsets approximately 21 per cent of the plant’s consumption from the national grid, and significantly reduces emissions to the environment. Building on this progress, the company has committed to a further 1 MW solar rooftop project at its Kalutara factory.

In addition to its solar energy projects, CEAT Kelani has implemented company-wide energy efficiency measures, biomass use for boiler operations, and a structured tree planting programme that will add 1,000 trees in multiple locations. The company also ensures that all raw materials are sourced exclusively from suppliers vetted by CEAT Ltd – India, which is committed to the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) goal of halving its carbon emissions by 2030 through sustainable sourcing and procurement practices.

To further institutionalise these efforts, CEAT Kelani has established a cross-functional Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Council, led by the Chief Operating Officer and comprising representatives from all business functions and employee levels. The council plays a pivotal role in embedding sustainability into the company’s culture and decision-making processes, ensuring continuous improvement and alignment with global ESG standards. Implementation of energy improvement projects that optimise energy consumption per kilogram (kWh/kg) of production is now a key performance indicator (KPI), the company said.
