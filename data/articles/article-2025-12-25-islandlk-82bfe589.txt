60-foot Christmas tree marks progress at Colombo International Airport Hotel site

Rising prominently against the skyline, a majestic 60-foot Christmas tree has been erected at the construction site of the Colombo International Airport Hotel (CIAH), symbolising a landmark moment in Sri Lanka’s tourism evolution.

The installation marks the steady progress of the nation’s first and only dedicated transit hotel. Situated strategically near Bandaranaike International Airport, the upcoming seven-storey, star-class facility will feature over 150 modern rooms.

For the project’s founder, Dr. Ruwan Perera, the tree is a profound symbol of resilience and faith.

“True success is not only found at the finish line, but in the journey itself,” says Dr. Perera. To him, the 60-foot structure reflects a personal journey of continuity and the firm vision required to transform the local landscape. As the project moves toward its grand opening next year, this illuminated landmark stands as a testament to growth, hope, and the ambitious future of Sri Lankan hospitality.
