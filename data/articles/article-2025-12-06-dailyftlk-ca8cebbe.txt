Ven. Assaji Thera further stated that groups working in close affiliation with the Gangaramaya Temple, both locally and internationally will extend their support to the fund in the future. He appreciated the efforts taken by the President to provide relief to the people during this difficult time and to guide the country with the correct leadership.

The President, recalling the role played by the Hunupitiya Gangaramaya Temple during every moment of national difficulty, expressed his appreciation for the donation and the temple’s continued support.

A group of resident and foreign monks, members of the Dayaka Sabha, foreign representatives and Secretary to the President Dr Nandika Sanath Kumanayake were also present at the occasion.
