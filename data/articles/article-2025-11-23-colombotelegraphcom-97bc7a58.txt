How Did LKY Develop Singapore From Nothing

Singapore’s founding father, Lee Kuan Yew (LKY), in his guest lecture at Harvard University in October 2000, humbly explained how he addressed national challenges and transformed Singapore from its difficult beginnings into a unified nation. He recounted winning nine consecutive elections since 1959 and meticulously planning the transition of leadership to a younger generation toward the end of his career, emphasizing that being pragmatic rather than dogmatic is an essential quality of effective leadership in today’s highly dynamic geopolitical environment.

The purpose of this publication is to inform not only the public but also our President Anura Kumara Dissanayake (AKD), who appears to be adopting a similar approach. A master of pragmatism, LKY articulated his core ideas on governance, leadership selection, and long-term planning with clarity and foresight.

Singapore was founded in 1965 as a multiracial, multicultural, and multi-religious nation. Lee Kuan Yew emphasised the importance of pragmatism in nation-building and explained why he made English the working language in a country with a 77% Chinese population, while still preserving everyone’s mother tongue. He also described how he promoted national integration by providing housing through a ballot system that mixed various ethnic groups.

His speech serves as a foundation for patriotic leaders striving to rebuild nations facing economic and moral decline. Lee highlighted that zero tolerance for corruption is essential, and that the honest decisions of genuine leaders—even if initially unpopular—are eventually recognised and appreciated by the people. Authentic leadership, he asserted, must guide the nation decisively. Elected leaders, he argued, need not rely solely on step-by-step democratic consensus throughout their tenure.

His words remind us that unity and prosperity depend on visionary, principled leadership. Listening to him makes one realise that some countries are still struggling in the dark, while his candid assessments of global politicians remain both fascinating and insightful.

“So suddenly, in August 1965, we had to create a nation out of a motley collection of Chinese, Indians, Malays, and others who came to Singapore seeking a better life—but not necessarily to be part of a nation. If I wanted people to take national service seriously, I could not ask other people’s sons to fight and die for the properties of the wealthy. Policies must be pragmatic, not dogmatic. I learned early to ignore political correctness and to reject conventional wisdom when it did not align with reality or my own experience.”

“What a country needs for growth and progress is stability and good government, one that is honest, effective, and works for the benefit of the people. Theories should never shackle good government, no matter how attractive or logically elegant they may seem.”

“Satellite television has allowed me to follow the American presidential campaign. I’m amazed at how media professionals can give a candidate a new image and transform him, at least superficially, into a different personality. Winning an election becomes, in large measure, a contest in packaging and advertising. A spin doctor is now a high-income professional, in great demand. From such a process, I doubt if a Churchill, Roosevelt or the like can emerge.”

“My work was on the small frame of an island, some 224 square miles at low tide, not to be compared with the white canvas of other world leaders. It is easier to recognise a man who is already a leader than to identify one before he becomes a leader. During my 40 years in office, I’ve met many foreign leaders—in government, in the military, and in business. The characteristics they had in common were self-confidence, breadth of mind, the ability to see the woods for the trees, and the ability to communicate. I am familiar with most of the first generation of anti-colonial leaders to which I belong. They all had strong nationalist convictions and wanted to prove that their people could measure up to their former rulers.”

“Unfortunately, many Third World leaders who had successfully overthrown the old order failed to build a new one. Establishing a new order required different and more complex skills—particularly in decision-making and economics—to achieve the highest returns on capital, skills they often lacked. They could not inspire their followers to continue the struggle against the remnants of the old regime, and they had oversimplified what needed to be done once the colonisers handed over power.”

He noted that leaders like Julius Nyerere of Tanzania and Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia, though honest and principled, followed interventionist economic models unsuited to their countries, whereas Kenya’s relatively free-market policies under Jomo Kenyatta and Daniel Moi allowed greater prosperity despite corruption.

He cited personal experiences during World War II with both the British and Japanese, which shaped his understanding of leadership, resilience, and the need for self-reliance:

“The first turning point of my life was World War II—the way the Japanese routed the British. … Another turning point was the experience of the brutality and cruelty of our Japanese conquerors. … Many of my friends shared this harrowing experience. We asked ourselves why the Japanese had the right to do this to us, and why the British had not fought more ferociously to defend us. … After the war, my contemporaries and I gathered in London… India had gained independence in 1947—so had Pakistan, Burma, and Ceylon. Why not Malaya, which then included Singapore?”

LKY recounted Singapore’s separation from Malaysia in 1965, emphasising pragmatism and survival:

“The British separated Singapore from Malaya as they prepared to grant independence to the Malays. … Within less than two years of federation, Singapore was asked to leave—and we had to agree, because the alternative was bloodshed. … Suddenly, in August 1965, we had to create a nation out of a motley collection of Chinese, Indians, Malays, and others who had come to Singapore seeking a better life, but not to form a nation.”

LKY avoided the mistakes of other postcolonial nations by courting foreign investment and adopting pragmatic economic policies:

“We first reached out to investors from Hong Kong and Taiwan… Later, major computer companies like Texas Instruments, Hewlett-Packard, and National Semiconductor decided to bypass Taiwan and Hong Kong, and we managed to attract them to Singapore. … We offered political stability, industrial peace, and English as our working language—strong pull factors for global investors.”

He also focused on long-term strategies to transform Singapore into a first-world hub, improving infrastructure, health, education, and civic habits.

“We encouraged everyone to learn two languages: English and their respective mother tongue. English was no one’s native language, so no one gained an unfair advantage, and we made it our working language. … Another critical decision was to build a national service–based armed force… Today, we have a credible defence capability.”

He stressed that leaders are trustees of the nation and must plan for succession, selecting candidates based on character, intellect, and resilience rather than academic credentials alone. Psychometric tests were introduced to ensure suitability for public office, and Singapore maintained integrity and low corruption through careful governance.

“Parents soon realised that their children’s future was best assured when they were competent in English. … We expanded our school system, built new technical institutes, polytechnics, and universities. This proved decisive for our progress.”

Plan for the distant future. Succession planning ensures long-term stability.

He observed that many Asian nations still achieve remarkable development by emphasising meritocracy and long-term planning, while some Western nations remain trapped in short-term electoral cycles.

This speech by LKY, delivered 25 years ago, remains highly relevant to Sri Lanka. We, too, are a multiracial, multireligious society with abundant natural resources. We must be pragmatic and work as one nation, using English as the working language while preserving mother tongues, faiths, and cultural practices. National security, entrepreneurship, education, honest governance, succession planning, and an independent judiciary are essential.

Political leaders should act as trustees, not perpetual campaigners, and citizens must understand the complexity of nation-building. Pragmatism, long-term planning, and meritocracy are our best paths forward. Sri Lanka can become an independent, developed country by collaborating wisely with all nations.

This speech is a must-watch for all citizens and politicians:
