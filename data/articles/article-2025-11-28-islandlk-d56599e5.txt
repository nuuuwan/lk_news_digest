Light a Life Children’s Fund marks 20 years of transforming lives in Kataragama

In a quiet village in Kataragama, a long-running charitable initiative has quietly reshaped futures for nearly two decades. The Light a Life Children’s Fund (LLCF) now approaches its 20th anniversary, having empowered approximately a thousand children and their families through access to quality education and improved housing.

LLCF, a charitable trust and voluntary social services / non governmental organisation, was established in 2006 with a mission to provide underprivileged children with the education, stability and opportunities they need to succeed, from their first day in preschool to university or vocational education.

The programmes are run entirely by volunteers, ensuring that donated funds go directly to the children and families who need it most – a testament to the power of continuity, care and community.

Today, LLCF proudly supports over 400 children annually across three core programmes. At the heart of the initiative is the Light a Life Preschool, located in Kandhasurindhugama, Kataragama. Established in 2007, the preschool currently accommodates up to 80 children aged 3 to 5 years, offering a nurturing, cost-free environment that aligns with national early childhood education guidelines.

Each child receives free educational material, school uniforms, and a nutritious mid-day meal, ensuring that no child is left behind. This foundation has enabled hundreds of children from low-income families to begin their education with dignity, stability and a strong sense of opportunity.

Beyond preschool, LLCF’s long-term scholarship programme ensures continuity throughout a child’s education journey. Children are supported from Grade 1 through to their O/Ls, A/Ls and tertiary education.
