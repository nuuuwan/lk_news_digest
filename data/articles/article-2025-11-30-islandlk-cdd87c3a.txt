Sri Lanka’s .LK domains set for global stage with new partnership

In a move to put Sri Lanka on the digital map, the LK Domain Registry has teamed up with ShortDot, a global domain specialist, to make .LK domains available worldwide.

This partnership will leverage ShortDot’s network of over 400 registrars, making it easier for international businesses and individuals to register a .LK address. The strategy includes marketing .LK as a short, modern alternative for “link,” moving beyond its traditional country-code identity.

“This is a major step in establishing .LK as a globally recognized domain,” said Prof. Gihan Dias of LK Domain Registry. ShortDot brings a proven track record, having helped the .qpon domain grow from a few hundred to over 30,000 registrations in just six months.

The collaboration aims to boost Sri Lanka’s digital identity, offering the world a new, versatile option for establishing an online presence.
