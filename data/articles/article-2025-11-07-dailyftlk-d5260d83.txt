Marking a decade of innovation and partnership between Germany and Sri Lanka, Bosch recently celebrated 10 years of operations in the country, reflecting on its impact, technological excellence, and commitment to sustainability progress.

Bosch, a leading global supplier of technology and services, celebrated its journey in Sri Lanka with an event themed ‘Transforming a Decade. Inspiring the Future’. The grand anniversary celebration was attended by Science and Technology Minister Prof. Chrishantha Abeysena, Bosch’s regional leadership, Government representatives, business partners, and academia.

Speaking at the event, the Minister highlighted that Bosch’s contribution went beyond advanced technologies and helped cultivate an ecosystem that strengthens industries, develops skills, and aligns Sri Lanka with global standards.

“Sri Lanka’s vision is to build a modern technological economy, one that tries on research, innovation and digital fascination. To achieve that, we need not only policies and infrastructure, but also trusted partners who believe in our potential and invest in our people,” he said.

He noted that partnerships like Bosch’s demonstrated how international investment could accelerate national development by transferring knowledge, building ecosystems, and inspiring new generations of innovators. The Minister called for continued focus on research, development, and local innovation to ensure Sri Lanka evolved from a consumer to a creator of technology.

Delivering a keynote address, German Ambassador to Sri Lanka Dr. Felix Neumann reflected on the strength of the long-standing partnership of over seven decades between Germany and Sri Lanka. He noted that the two countries shared aligned priorities such as security, freedom, and prosperity, with Sri Lanka’s economic reform policy aligning closely with Germany’s foreign policy.

Neumann expressed confidence that Bosch would continue to play a central role in driving innovation in Sri Lanka and enhance livelihoods of those it impacts.

In 2024, Bosch reported sales of 90.3 billion euros and employs around 417,900 employees, operating across four key sectors: mobility, industrial technology, consumer goods, and energy and building technology. The company’s strategy focuses on using technology to help shape universal trends such as automation, electrification, digitalisation, connectivity, and an orientation to sustainability. In this context, its broad diversification across regions and industries continues to strengthen its innovative capacity and long-term resilience.

Describing Sri Lanka’s market as a key market in Bosch’s regional growth story, Bosch Group India and South Asia President and Bosch Ltd., Managing Director Guruprasad Mudlapur said that the company aimed to “make things better and bigger” for the country’s industrial sector through sustained investment and collaboration.

He explained that while global markets remained uncertain, with weak growth in Europe and shifting trade conditions, emerging economies like Sri Lanka offered real potential. “We are very seriously working towards aligning our growth and vision with the Sri Lankan Government’s vision of ensuring sustainable growth, technology, digitisation and innovation. We believe a lot of what we do gels well with the Government’s vision of how the industry should perform in Sri Lanka.”

“This milestone marks ten years of dedication, innovation, and trust. We are deeply grateful to our employees, customers, and partners for their continued support. As we step into the next decade, Bosch Sri Lanka remains committed to driving transformation, innovation, and skill development to inspire the future,” added Robert Bosch Lanka Managing Director Sandeep Kamat.
