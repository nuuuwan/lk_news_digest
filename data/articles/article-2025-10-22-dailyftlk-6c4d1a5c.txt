President reassigns key institutions under ministries

President Anura Kumara Disanayake has issued a special gazette, dated 18 October 2025, redefining the functions and institutions coming under several ministries following the recent Cabinet reshuffle. The reallocation marks one of the most extensive administrative reorganisations in recent years, affecting core areas such as defence, public security, finance, energy, and transport.

Under the new arrangement, the Civil Security Department (CSD) has been moved from the Ministry of Defence to the Ministry of Public Security, which also now oversees the Sri Lanka International Arbitration Centre and the Office of the Commissioner General of Rehabilitation.

The Ministry of Defence, in turn, has been assigned the National Hydrology Council and the Sri Lanka National Hydrology Office.

The Ministry of Finance, Economic Development and Fiscal Management now includes Hotel Developers (Lanka) Ltd. and the Casino Regulatory Authority, consolidating oversight over key State enterprises and gaming regulation.

In the energy sector, the Lanka Electricity Company Ltd. and its subsidiaries have been added to the Ministry of Power and Energy, while the Atomic Energy Board and Atomic Energy Regulatory Council have been shifted to the Ministry of Science and Technology which will also handle nuclear oversight functions.

The Ministry of Health and Media has gained several new institutions, including the State Trading (General) Corporation Ltd., Salasine Media Solutions Ltd., the Ayurveda Education and Health Board, and the Sri Lanka Nursing Council, while Sri Lanka Triposha Ltd. has been reassigned to the Ministry of Trade, Food Security and Cooperative Development.

Other notable changes include the addition of the Commission for Online Safety and the Colombo Lotus Tower Management Company to the Ministry of Digital Economy, and the transfer of the National Secretariat for Non-Governmental Organisations and the Partnership Secretariat for World Food Program Cooperation to the Ministry of Rural Development, Social Security and Community Empowerment.

The newly formed Ministry of Transport, Highways and Urban Development will oversee 17 institutions, including the Road Development Authority, National Transport Commission, Sri Lanka Railways, Urban Development Authority, and the Motor Traffic Department.

In addition, the Ministry of Ports and Civil Aviation Services now supervises the Sri Lanka Ports Authority and its subsidiaries, Lanka Shipping Corporation Ltd., the Civil Aviation Authority, Airport and Aviation Services (Lanka) Ltd., and SriLankan Airlines Ltd.

The Ministry of Housing, Construction and Water Supply has been expanded to include the National Housing Development Authority, State Engineering Corporation, Building Materials Corporation Ltd., National Machinery Institute, and the National Water Supply and Drainage Board.

The gazette consolidates functions across ministries to reflect the new Cabinet structure, streamlining oversight of State institutions and regulatory bodies under the reconstituted administration.
