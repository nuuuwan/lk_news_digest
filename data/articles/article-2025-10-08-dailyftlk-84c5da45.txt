Police warn of rising online fraud via Telegram, WhatsApp

Sri Lanka Police have issued a public warning about an increase in online scams being carried out through popular messaging platforms such as Telegram and WhatsApp.

According to Police, cybercriminals are using deceptive methods to gain access to usersâ€™ online accounts, including tricking victims into revealing their usernames and passwords through fake links and QR codes. Once the information is obtained, the fraudsters block the original owners from their accounts and use them to carry out further scams.

Investigations have revealed that these criminals often lure victims by offering fake job opportunities and requesting payments under various pretexts.

The Police urged the public to exercise caution when responding to unsolicited messages or offers circulated through social media groups, even if they appear to come from known contacts or familiar platforms. They also advised against clicking on links or visiting websites shared through such messages.

Authorities further cautioned users to ignore requests for money transfers, currency exchanges, or the use of personal bank accounts for third-party transactions, even if made by acquaintances on platforms like Viber or WhatsApp.

Police emphasised that users should never share sensitive information such as account credentials or one-time passwords (OTPs) with anyone and should verify the authenticity of online payment requests before proceeding.

The public has been urged to remain alert and adopt secure digital practices to avoid falling victim to these increasingly sophisticated online scams.
