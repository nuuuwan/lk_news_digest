BigWin partners National Lotteries Board to take  Sri Lanka’s lottery system online

BigWin has joined hands with the National Lotteries Board (NLB) to bring Sri Lanka’s lottery system into the digital era.

The partnership allows players to buy official NLB tickets online, offering a faster, safer, and more convenient experience. Every ticket sold through BigWin is genuine and officially sourced. The platform follows strict security standards to protect users’ personal and payment details. It also ensures that all draws are transparent and fair, giving players confidence in every purchase.

A major issue with the traditional lottery has been unclaimed prizes. Many winners miss out because they lose their tickets or forget to check results. BigWin has solved that problem. Tickets are stored securely in each user’s account, and instant alerts notify them of wins. Prize money is credited directly, removing the risk of missed winnings.

Through BigWin, players can take part in all major national lotteries, including Mahajana Sampatha, Dhana Nidhanaya, Mega Power, Govisetha, Handahana, Ada Sampatha, Suba Dawsak, and Jaya. The platform offers several ways to play, the familiar Brown Ticket option, Quick Buy for instant purchases, and a Subscription mode that automatically enters users into selected draws.

By going paperless, BigWin is also supporting a greener Sri Lanka. The platform reduces paper waste while making lottery participation more open and accessible to everyone. BigWin combines verified partnerships, user-friendly design, and secure technology to make online lottery play simple and trustworthy. It also promotes responsible participation and fair access to all. With this new partnership, Sri Lankans can now enjoy their favourite national lotteries without the usual risks or delays.
