Switzerland sends WASH relief support to Sri Lanka

Switzerland has delivered a consignment of essential WASH relief equipment and personnel to support Sri Lanka’s disaster response efforts following recent extreme weather conditions.

The cargo, which arrived at the Bandaranaike International Airport on Saturday, was officially handed over by a visiting Swiss WASH (Water, Sanitation and Hydration) Mission delegation led by Team Leader of the WASH Mission Martin Bölsterli, and Senior Coordinator of the Mission Yvonne Josy Müller.

The consignment includes water purifiers designed to ensure safe drinking water in disaster-affected communities, along with the deployment of WASH technical personnel to support implementation on the ground.

The relief package was received on behalf of Sri Lanka by former Director of Preparedness at the Disaster Management Centre (DMC), Sunil Jayaweera, who is currently volunteering in support of national response operations following his retirement. Swiss Deputy Ambassador Olivier Praz was also present.

Officials said the Swiss assistance will help strengthen access to clean water in areas where supply systems have been damaged and will support humanitarian agencies working to restore essential services.

The arrival of the Swiss WASH Mission forms part of continued international support being extended to Sri Lanka as the country works to stabilise conditions in communities affected by the disaster.
