Round Table Sri Lanka delivers rapid, high-impact relief following Cyclone Ditwah

In the aftermath of Cyclone Ditwah’s severe flooding across the Western Province, Round Table Sri Lanka (RTSL) has emerged as one of the nation’s fastest and most effective humanitarian responders, deploying urgent relief operations since 28 November 2025.

RTSL’s first major mission launched in Welampitiya, delivering emergency food parcels, ration packs, medication, and bedsheets to families stranded for days by rising floodwaters. As the disaster expanded, RTSL rapidly scaled its operations, navigating submerged roads and inaccessible areas to reach vulnerable communities across multiple districts.

• Dry ration airlifts underway to regions inaccessible by road

• Ongoing fundraising for rations, food parcels, and rescue logistics

In partnership with Yahaguna Padanama and supported logistically by Expolanka, RTSL has begun airlifting dry rations to isolated communities, ensuring uninterrupted support to areas where land access has been completely blocked by floodwaters. Food parcels and ration packs airlifted via the airforce.
