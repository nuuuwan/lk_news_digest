Mark and Comm presents strategic communications framework to Deputy Minister for Sri Lanka’s USD15b digital economy transformation

Mark and Comm (Pvt) Ltd, Sri Lanka’s leading boutique public relations (PR) and communications agency, presented a comprehensive Strategic Communications and PR framework to Deputy Minister of Digital Economy, Hon. Eranga Weeraratne.

The presentation, led by managing director Thanzyl Thajudeen, emphasized that world-class technology infrastructure should come with public trust, stakeholder understanding, and sustained adoption. Drawing on global case studies including Singapore’s “Smart Nation” initiative, Estonia’s e-governance leadership, Malaysia’s Digital Economy Blueprint, and India’s Digital India programme, the framework demonstrates that successful digital transformation depends equally on communications strategy as on digital strategy.

The comprehensive framework addresses four critical outcomes: building public understanding through segmented stakeholder messaging, creating confidence in government leadership and digital system security, driving actual adoption of digital services, and attracting international investment and talent.
