UB40 concert … absolutely magical

The UB40 concert at The Warfield, in San Francisco, in the USA, on Friday, 26th September, 2025, was part of their Relentless Tour, and taking in the scene was Mahesha Manjuka Warusawitharana who described the concert as absolutely magical; “More than I ever expected.”

She went on to say that seeing UB40 live at the Warfield, in SF, was something else!

“Growing up in Sri Lanka, in the ’80s, I loved their music, and that night I felt like I was transported back home. singing every lyric, feeling every beat.

“My cousin Samanthika and her husband Bharatha were with me and the three of us were totally in the zone, like time hadn’t passed at all. It brought back so many memories … old school days, cassette tapes, and those chill evenings back home; pure nostalgia. It’s a night I’ll always remember.”

Mahesha went on to say that Warfield is a historic theatre with great acoustics, and that particular night it felt electric.

“From the moment the doors opened, there was a buzz in the air … people chatting, smiling, excited. The crowd filled the seats quickly; by showtime, it was nearly full, a mix of longtime fans, couples, and folks who just love good reggae.

“UB40 came on strong. Their stage presence is still confident and warm. The band members moved with ease, engaged the audience, and their interaction felt genuine, not just performative. The lighting was atmospheric, but not flashy; it let the music shine. I felt the energy shift in the room as the set progressed.

“One thing I admired: they didn’t just play the hits; they wove in some deeper cuts and slower tunes, too, giving space for us to soak in the emotion.

“Their playlist that evening included ‘Here I Am (Come and Take Me),’ ‘Homely Girl,’ ‘Sing Our Own Song,’ ‘One in Ten,’ ‘Many Rivers to Cross,’ ‘Red, Red Wine,’ ‘Kingston Town,’ and ‘Can’t Help Falling in Love.’

“When they did ‘Red, Red Wine,’ the whole theatre sang along. It was like all of us were transported together, singing that song from our memories.

“The audience was totally engaged singing, clapping, swaying, cheering. At times it felt more like a gathering of friends than a concert. I glanced around: smiles, tears, people recording on their phones but also just pausing, eyes closed, lost in the moment.

“It was unbelievable to hear the roar of the crowd right before UB40 broke into ‘Kingston Town.’

“The UB40 concert wasn’t just a show; it was a bridge across time. UB40 still has that magic; they can summon decades of memories and make them alive in the present.

“For me personally, having my cousin and her husband with me made it even more special. We shared looks, sang together, and, at one point, I felt all those years melt away. It was more than nostalgia — it was reclamation of a piece of home.”
