India delivers fresh relief as Army Field Hospital concludes mission in Sri Lanka

As the Indian Army Field Hospital team concluded its humanitarian mission in Sri Lanka and returned to India on Sunday under Operation Sagar Bandhu, appreciation was conveyed for the team’s dedicated and professional service in supporting affected communities.

Coinciding with the team’s departure, humanitarian supplies requested by the Sri Lankan authorities were delivered to the country. A total of 10 tonnes of medicines and 15 tonnes of dry rations were transported aboard an Indian Air Force C-17 Globemaster aircraft, which also carried the returning medical team. The supplies are intended to support ongoing relief efforts for communities impacted by the recent crisis following Cyclone Ditwah.

Further assistance arrived yesterday with 50 tonnes of dry rations reaching Sri Lanka aboard the Indian Coast Guard Ship Shaurya. The consignment was formally handed over by India’s Deputy High Commissioner Dr. Satyanjal Pandey to Deputy Minister of Ports and Civil Aviation Janitha Ruwan Kodithuwakku.

The completion of the medical mission and the continued delivery of relief supplies under Operation Sagar Bandhu highlight the close cooperation and longstanding friendship between Sri Lanka and India in times of need.
