Govt. moves to abolish MP pensions

Cabinet directs to gazette and table Parliamentary Pensions Law (Repeal) Bill for Parliament approval

The Government is moving to abolish pension entitlements for Parliament Ministers and their spouses with the Cabinet of Ministers on Monday approving the publishing of the Parliamentary Pensions Law (Repeal) Bill in the Government gazette and submitting it to Parliament for approval.

The move comes following the Attorney General’s clearance for the Bill.

On 16 June, the Cabinet of Ministers approved in principle to repeal the Parliamentary Pension Act No. 1 of 1971 of the State Council.

“As promised, a draft Bill prepared by the Legal Draftsman to repeal the Parliamentary Pensions Act with the aim of abolishing the pension entitlements granted to elected representatives to Parliament and their spouses has got Attorney General’s approval,” Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa said at the weekly post-Cabinet meeting media briefing yesterday.

He assured that the law will apply from the time it is enacted and not retrospectively. “Once enacted the reforms would abolish lifetime pensions for MPs, which they currently receive after five years of service,” he clarified.

Dr. Jayatissa said the move is in line with the Government’s broader policy vision titled ‘Pohosath Ratak – Lassana Jeewithayak’ (A Wealthy Country – A Beautiful Life), which was presented to the public as part of the Government’s mandate.

He said the decision reflects the people’s will. “People voted for this Government to repeal the excessive and unjustified benefits previously granted to former Presidents and MPs,” he added.

The proposal to this effect was submitted by Justice and National Integration Minister Harshana Nanayakkara.
