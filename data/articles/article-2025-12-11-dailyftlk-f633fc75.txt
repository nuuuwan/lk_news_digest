How Sri Lankan workplace culture allows fraud to thrive — and what we can do about it

When decisions are unquestioned simply because they come from seniority, suspicious behaviour passes without scrutiny

In a small country like Sri Lanka, reputational damage can have long-term consequences. Speaking up against wrongdoing—even through proper channels—can lead to stigma. Employees fear losing their job, being sidelined, or facing retaliation from powerful individuals.

Fraud in Sri Lankan organisations is not just a question of weak controls and/or antiquated systems. Rather, it is intricately linked to the cultures of our workplaces-our attitudes toward authority, relationships, conflict, and reputation. These cultural dynamics foster an environment in which wrongdoing can start silently, grow over time, and be hidden longer than may be possible in more rules-driven environments.

This layer of the culture should be properly understood if one is serious about fighting fraud. Most organisations invest in systems and audits, yet they completely disregard the quiet patterns of behaviour that accommodate fraud. It is now time to honestly take a look at habits, norms, and social pressures that keep people silent, questioning discouraged, and misconduct normalised.

The traditional workplaces in Sri Lanka are hierarchical. Challenging a superior, even with good intentions, is often perceived as disrespectful. To many employees, questioning the manager, financial head, or director feels like crossing the line.

This silence provides fertile ground for fraud. When decisions are unquestioned simply because they come from seniority, suspicious behaviour passes without scrutiny. Employees may notice inconsistencies but keep quiet, convinced that “it’s not my place” to raise concerns.

This respect for authority is culturally valued yet inadvertently protects those who misuse their power.

Another feature of Sri Lankan business culture is its heavy reliance on personal relationships. Friendships, school networks, political connections, and family ties shape recruitment, procurement, and everyday workplace dynamics. The familiar “yaluwa system” functions as an informal support network-but it also becomes a blind spot.

When the wrongdoing involves an acquaintance or someone of influence, employees and auditors alike often turn a blind eye. Nepotism makes some individuals immune from scrutiny. An individual who enjoys strong political backing or social standing becomes “untouchable”.

In such environments, loyalty outweighs accountability, and personal ties override formal controls.

Sri Lankan society tends to avoid confrontation. The preference for harmony and subtle communication means that raising concerns is often seen as creating unnecessary trouble. Employees fear being labelled difficult or aggressive.

This desire to avoid conflict becomes a silent enabler of misconduct. Fraud rarely flourishes in places where people speak openly; it thrives in environments where uncomfortable conversations are avoided.

In a small country like Sri Lanka, reputational damage can have long-term consequences. Speaking up against wrongdoing—even through proper channels—can lead to stigma. Employees fear losing their job, being sidelined, or facing retaliation from powerful individuals.

This fear of social and professional fallout discourages whistleblowing. Even when mechanisms exist, the cultural fear of being labelled a “troublemaker” often outweighs the incentive to report misconduct.

We tend to give automatic trust to long-serving employees, elders, family members, or colleagues from the same school or village. While trust builds strong relationships, it reduces scrutiny.

Unfortunately, these trusted individuals often have the greatest opportunity to commit long-running fraud because no one suspects them. In many Sri Lankan fraud cases, the perpetrator is not an outsider, but a familiar figure who had operated without question for years.

Minor unethical acts—small cash leakages, favour exchanges, side commissions—are sometimes brushed off as harmless or “normal”. But these small wrongs create a slippery slope. Once employees see that small compromises are tolerated, larger schemes become easier to justify and easier to hide.

Fraud rarely starts big. It begins where cultural tolerance allows it to begin.

Sri Lanka can significantly reduce fraud—not by challenging cultural norms, but by working with them. By designing controls that respect hierarchy, relationships, and communication preferences, organisations can build environments where integrity becomes the natural choice

Reducing fraud requires solutions that respect cultural realities while strengthening organisational integrity. The goal is not to fight culture, but to design controls that work with it.

1. Strengthen tone at the top through visible ethical leadership

Because Sri Lankan workplaces are highly hierarchical, positive change must come from senior leaders.

CEOs, secretaries, and directors should publicly commit to ethical conduct.

When employees see leaders doing the right thing, it lowers the fear of reporting wrongdoing.

2. Strengthen whistleblower protection – Introduce safe, culturally sensitive reporting channels

Traditional whistleblowing channels often fail because employees fear confrontation and retaliation.

Introduce “speak-up ambassadors” — trusted, trained intermediaries who employees can approach informally.

This aligns with cultural norms of indirect communication while still enabling issue escalation.

Train staff to raise concerns respectfully using non-confrontational language. This helps overcome cultural barriers without challenging hierarchy.

4. Build trust in processes, not just people – Redesign controls to reduce personal discretion

These measures reduce the influence of personal relationships on financial decisions.

In family and relationship-driven businesses, mandate conflict-of-interest disclosures and independent oversight on related-party transactions.

Traditional fraud training is often too technical and fails to resonate. Sri Lankan employees respond better to relatable examples.

Use role plays and informal discussions instead of lecture-style training

While personal connections are normal in Sri Lankan workplaces, they can weaken controls if not managed properly.

The goal is not to eliminate relationships, but to ensure fairness and proper oversight.

Automation provides a neutral buffer in cultures where personal influence is strong.

Internal audit and risk functions are often viewed with suspicion or as “fault finders”.

Hold open-door “assurance clinics” where staff can ask questions safely

Sri Lankan employees respond well to team-based norms rather than individual pressure.

Supervisors held jointly accountable for fraud incidents happening under their watch

Leveraging group dynamics can create internal pressure to uphold integrity.

In close-knit workplaces, fear of gossip or reputational damage prevents people from acting.

These help protect individuals who come forward or become subject to inquiries.

Employees often avoid reporting issues because they find policies too complex.

Clear, simple policies are easier to follow—and harder to misuse.

Ethics becomes part of daily conversation rather than an annual formality.

A major cultural barrier is the belief that “nothing will happen” to connected individuals.

Sri Lanka can significantly reduce fraud—not by challenging cultural norms, but by working with them. By designing controls that respect hierarchy, relationships, and communication preferences, organisations can build environments where integrity becomes the natural choice. If organisations recognise these cultural dynamics and design solutions that respect our social fabric, we can build workplaces where honesty becomes the norm and misconduct struggles to survive.
