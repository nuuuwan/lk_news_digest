Jaffna named among Best Cities to Visit in 2026 by Lonely Planet

The global travel media giant Lonely Planet has announced its prestigious annual list of destinations under the “Best in Travel 2026” publication, naming Jaffna among the Best Cities to Visit in 2026.

This recognition marks a significant milestone for Sri Lanka, reaffirming the country’s growing appeal as a diverse, authentic and sustainable travel destination. The selection of Jaffna highlights not only the city’s cultural and historical richness, but also the success of Sri Lanka’s continued efforts to promote its regional diversity.

Lonely Planet, the world’s most trusted name in travel publishing, publishes the “Best in Travel” series annually, celebrating 30 of the most inspiring destinations across the globe. The destinations are chosen by Lonely Planet’s network of editors, writers and travel experts, focusing on innovation, sustainability and unique visitor experiences. Every year these expert analysts explore the most remote areas of the world in search for unparalleled locations to include in “Best in Travel” list.

The Italian-language edition of Lonely Planet’s Best in Travel 2026 was officially unveiled on 22 October, at a high-profile press event held at Identità Golose Milano, organised by Lonely Planet Italia. The event was attended by Italian mainstream media representatives, travel influencers, content creators, tour operators and industry professionals from across Italy. Representing “Sri Lanka Tourism”, the Consulate General of Sri Lanka in Milan contributed to the occasion by offering a selection of signature dishes from Jaffna for the luncheon that followed the event and by arranging a guest speech introducing the destination during the press briefing.

This recognition is expected to contribute significantly to enhancing Sri Lanka’s tourism visibility in the international tourism arena. It also serves as a valuable endorsement for the country’s ongoing efforts to promote regional tourism development and community-based travel experiences in lesser-known destinations.

As one of the world’s most trusted and influential travel media brands, Lonely Planet’s recommendations reach millions of readers, travellers and industry professionals across both digital and print platforms. Inclusion in the Best in Travel list not only validates the destination’s unique attractions, authenticity and visitor experience, but also serves as a powerful marketing endorsement that can boost tourist arrivals, strengthen brand positioning and attract new partnerships within the global travel industry.

Representing Sri Lanka Tourism, the Consul General of Sri Lanka in Milan Dulmith Waruna and the Minister Counsellor (Commercial) Tharaka Botheju graced the official ceremony held in Italy targeting the Italian travellers and tour operators.
