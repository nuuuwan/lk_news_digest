Cabinet clears two major health sector procurements to strengthen critical care and essential drug supplies

In a move aimed at boosting the country’s health system and ensuring continuity in critical patient care, the Cabinet of Ministers last week approved two key procurements involving spinal surgery equipment and essential medication for anaemia and thalassemia patients.

The first decision relates to the purchase of 48 polyaxial MR-compatible lumbar pedicle screws, specialised titanium and cobalt-chrome implants used to stabilise the spine, correct deformities, and treat fractures and tumours during spinal surgeries.

Following an international competitive bidding process that attracted three submissions, the Cabinet approved awarding the contract to Avenierr Pharma Ltd., of Sri Lanka, representing manufacturer Miraclus Orthotech Ltd., of India.

“The company was identified as the only substantially responsive bidder, with the procurement valued at Rs. 136.32 million as recommended by the high-level Standing Procurement Committee,” Cabinet Spokesman and Health Minister Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa said at the weekly post-Cabinet meeting media briefing on Thursday.

In a separate approval, the Cabinet cleared the procurement of 540,000 vials of Desferrioxamine Mesylate for Injection BP, a lifesaving drug used to remove excess iron in patients with anaemia and thalassemia who require regular blood transfusions.

Two international bids were received, and based on the recommendation of the higher-level Standing Procurement Committee, the contract was awarded to ABC Pharma Services Ltd., of Sri Lanka, sourcing from Gland Pharma Limited of India. At Rs. 791.1 million, the company was also the only bidder deemed substantially responsive,” he said.

Dr. Jayatissa said both procurements are essential to maintaining uninterrupted treatment for vulnerable patient groups and improving outcomes in specialised surgical procedures.
