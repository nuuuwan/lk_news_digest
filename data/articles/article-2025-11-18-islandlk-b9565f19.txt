Double Cab debacle – Soviet-style standardisation

The NPP government’s decision to procure 1,775 brand-new double cab pickup trucks, at a staggering cost exceeding Rs. 12,500 million, represents not merely a questionable procurement decision, but a dangerous convergence of fiscal irresponsibility, procedural irregularities, and a disturbing drift toward authoritarian governance. What the government presents as a solution to transport inefficiencies is, upon closer examination, a regressive policy that abandons proven private sector practices, multiplies taxpayer burdens, and signals an ominous shift in the political culture of our already fragile democracy.

During a TV debate last week, an NPP representative responded, saying that the LKR 12,500 million figure was merely a lease payment, when an Opposition member questioned how a brand-new double cab could cost only 7 million. Both arguments missed the mark. Yes, a vehicle can cost around 7 million when it’s duty-free, but it remains unclear whether these purchases were actually made through leasing arrangements. The real issue, however, is far more serious: if the government coffers are already overflowing with trillions, why resort to additional interest-bearing debt? This raises fundamental questions about fiscal discipline and transparency in public spending.

The irregularities surrounding this tender are brazen enough to warrant immediate investigation. The standard 42-day National Competitive Bidding (NCB) window was compressed into a mere 12 days, a manipulation that serves only one purpose: to limit competition and favour pre-selected bidders. When MP Dr. Harsha de Silva raised these concerns during the Budget debate, he wasn’t merely engaging in political theater; he was exposing what appears to be a textbook case of tender rigging.

The eligibility criteria look as tailored for one or two companies: 10 years of experience supplying specified vehicles, delivery of at least 1,000 similar vehicles in the past decade, 10 service centres nationwide (including five outside the Western Province), average annual turnover of Rs. 10 billion for 2017-2019, and Rs. 50 million security deposit. These requirements, combined with the compressed timeline, effectively eliminate genuine competition, a cardinal sin in public procurement.

The government’s silence on these allegations is deafening. When confronted, officials pass responsibility like a hot potato: the Ministry of Public Security claims no involvement, the Treasury points to the Department of Fiscal Policy, and Director General Dr. M.K.C. Senanayake remains unreachable. This bureaucratic shell game is precisely how corruption flourishes in broad daylight.

The irony of this policy becomes stark when examined through the lens of contemporary business practices and cost benefit analysis of Buy Vs Lease. The concept of “company-maintained car” has already moved toward employee car loans and allowances in many companies. This transition wasn’t ideological; it was driven by hard-nosed financial analysis. (Figure 1)

The numbers tell an unambiguous story. Under the permit system, the government bore only the cost of duty exemption, essentially foregone revenue on vehicles MPs would purchase anyway. Under the new fleet system also the government still have to bear the cost of duty exemption, in addition, taxpayers fund not just the purchase but every aspect of ownership: maintenance, insurance, fuel, depreciation, and bureaucratic overhead. This is fiscal masochism dressed as reform.

On the other hand, when employees own their vehicles, they maintain them better, use them more judiciously and carefully, and bear the consequences of their choices. The government is now racing backward toward a model that the business world rejected as inefficient and unaccountable.

The government justifies this expensive reversal by claiming MPs exploit duty-free permits, selling them or importing luxury vehicles. This argument is intellectually dishonest on multiple levels.

First, if MPs sell their permits, so what? The permit represented the government’s contribution to their transportation needs. If an MP chose to monetize that benefit and use alternative transport, or a less expensive vehicle, that was their choice and potentially saved the government money on maintenance and fuel they would otherwise consume.

Second, the new system doesn’t eliminate the underlying incentive for personal gain; it merely socialises all costs. The “corruption” concern is a smokescreen. Under the permit system, any financial benefit accrued to the individual MP was visible. Under the fleet system, waste and corruption are diffused across bureaucratic processes, harder to trace, easier to perpetuate.

Third, and most damningly, the government now pays for everything the permit covered, plus the vehicle cost itself, plus all operating expenses. This is not reform; it’s fiscal suicide. We’ve moved from “MPs might profit from permits” to “taxpayers definitely pay for everything while MPs enjoy government-funded transport.”

Beyond financial stupidity there is a more frightening political motive. This policy represents a philosophical shift toward uniformity and state control that should alarm anyone who values democratic pluralism and individual autonomy, (Figure 2)

By mandating that all representatives, parliamentary as well as local government, use identical, government-issued vehicles, the regime is imposing a Soviet-style uniformity, reminiscent of the USSR’s infamous standardisation, where citizens could have any car they wanted, as long as it was a Lada. This isn’t merely about vehicles; it’s about control and conformity.

In a democracy, elected representatives should have the option to choose modes suited to their constituencies, personal circumstances, and preferences, within reasonable cost parameters. A representative from a mountainous district might need different transport than one from Colombo. An MP might prefer a more efficient sedan, such as EV, Hybrid or plug-in hybrid, over a diesel guzzler. These choices reflect democratic diversity.

The government’s “one vehicle fits all” approach betrays an authoritarian impulse: standardisation over choice, conformity over flexibility, central control over individual autonomy. When the state dictates even the vehicle you must drive, it signals a broader tendency toward control that extends beyond logistics into political culture.

Here’s the uncomfortable arithmetic: Why 1,775 double cabs? The government’s vague explanations about “government institutions” don’t withstand scrutiny.

The timing is suspicious. With local government bodies now dominated by NPP/JVP cadres following recent electoral victories, this massive procurement looks less like rational fleet management and more like political patronage, a mechanism to reward party loyalists, strengthen party machinery, and entrench political power through material inducements.

This isn’t governance; it’s machine politics. The double cabs become instruments of political consolidation, distributed to party-faithful across the country, binding them to the regime through material dependence. The fiscal cost is borne by all citizens; the political benefit accrues exclusively to the ruling party.

This procurement debacle must be understood within the broader context of Budget 2026, a document that betrays alarming short-term thinking, precisely when Sri Lanka needs strategic, long-term fiscal discipline.

We face resumed debt repayments in 2028 requiring foreign reserves of at least USD 13 billion. The rupee crisis is not resolved; the revenue surge from vehicle import duties is a temporary bubble that will burst. In this precarious context, spending Rs. 12,500+ million on unnecessary vehicles while committing to billions more in recurring costs represents a dereliction of fiscal responsibility.

The NPP rode to power on promises of “system change” and exemplary governance. Instead, we’re witnessing the same old playbook: opaque tender processes, fiscal profligacy, bureaucratic obfuscation, and the use of state resources for political advantage. The party that once positioned itself “above suspicion like Caesar’s wife” now looks remarkably like Caesar himself, accumulating power, dispensing patronage, and showing contempt for democratic accountability.

The NPP government must decide: Will it honour its mandate for systemic reform, or will it become another iteration of the same corrupt, inefficient, authoritarian tendencies it once condemned? The double cab debacle is a test, and so far, the government is failing spectacularly.

The people who voted for change deserve better than a fleet of pickup trucks purchased through questionable procedures, financed by their taxes, and distributed as political favours. They deserve a government that respects democratic norms, fiscal responsibility, and the basic principle that public resources belong to the public, not to party machinery.

If the government proceeds with this procurement, despite overwhelming evidence of its folly, it will signal that we’ve moved from democracy to what the editorial of this newspaper on Tuesday 11th November, 2025, aptly termed “kleptokakistocracy”, (Klepto – from kleptocracy,  meaning rule by thieves or those who exploit power for personal gain. Kakisto – from kakistocracy, meaning government by the worst, least qualified, or most unscrupulous individuals; cracy – meaning a system of governance.

And that road leads only to ruin, fiscal, political, and moral.
