Milinda Problem: The Missing Buddhist Mandate

Most of what we see in modern rulers resembles a Turkish proverb: when a clown enters a palace, he assumes he will become a king, but instead the palace becomes a circus. Democracy is visibly crumbling, yet no convincing alternative has appeared. The most pragmatic models of governance once proposed by anarchist thinkers have been so badly misrepresented that many people now equate anarchism solely with chaos. Yet early anarchist texts and contemporary writers such as Noam Chomsky are clear: properly understood, anarchism offers tools to dismantle entrenched inequality and bureaucratic apathy, enabling decentralised decision-making and genuinely participatory politics. But the birth of a new system of governance is slow, far slower than our political impatience allows. If anything truly new is to emerge, it may not mature until the coming decades.

Meanwhile, what has unfolded in countries that claim Buddhist heritage is especially disheartening. Many Buddhist-majority nations today are mired in corruption, with political structures that have hardened into unresponsive, self-protective systems. Leaders no longer trust monastic institutions; temples increasingly resemble financial enterprises sustaining the comforts of senior monks. The ethical foundations the Buddha emphasised—compassion, equanimity, self-restraint—have largely faded from public life. As Aravind Adiga quips in The White Tiger, if the Buddha returned to witness the behaviour of many who claim to follow him, he would run immediately without looking back. Cultures once committed to moral clarity and dharmic governance have become parodies of their guiding philosophies.

It is here that the Milinda Pañha offers a corrective. Though framed as a religious dialogue, it contains a form of political wisdom urgently relevant today. The text records conversations between King Menander I—known in Buddhist tradition as Milinda—and the monk Nâgasena. Menander, ruling from roughly 165 to 130 BCE, governed a relatively small Indo-Greek kingdom across parts of north-western India and Afghanistan. Unlike Emperor Ashoka, whose empire was vast and centrally controlled, Menander oversaw a fragmented realm more reminiscent of Hellenistic city-states. His coins, blending Greek and Indian motifs, and the bilingual inscriptions of his era demonstrate a ruler versed in cultural negotiation and administrative pragmatism. Although no evidence suggests direct influence from Ashoka, Menander clearly lived within a Buddhist intellectual atmosphere shaped by earlier imperial reforms.

The Milinda Pañha captures a rare moment: a Hellenistic ruler engaging seriously with Indian philosophical thought. Menander approaches Nâgasena with disarming humility, asking sharp and often sceptical questions rather than asserting royal authority. The dialogues follow a method of inquiry not unlike the Socratic tradition, though rooted in Buddhist reasoning. Milinda challenges, Nâgasena clarifies, and truth emerges through structured questioning.

The famous opening conversation is well known. Milinda asks, “Venerable sir, what is your name?” Nâgasena replies, “I am called Nâgasena, Majesty. But ‘Nâgasena’ is only a name, a convenient designation. In the ultimate sense, there is no person here to be found.” Milinda presses the point: “If there is no Nâgasena, then what stands before me? Are your robes Nâgasena? Is your bowl Nâgasena? Is your body or your mind Nâgasena?” Nâgasena answers calmly: “No, Majesty. None of these is Nâgasena. Yet because these parts occur together, the name is used—just as ‘chariot’ is spoken of although no single piece is the chariot itself.”

This method continues through the text. In another exchange, the king asks, “If there is no permanent self, who receives the results of actions?” Nâgasena responds, “Majesty, the deed and its fruit meet within a stream of continuity. The one who acts and the one who experiences the result are connected like one lamp lighting another—new, yet not disconnected.”

At times, Milinda’s challenges resemble those in Greek philosophical dialogues, though the content remains distinctly Buddhist. He asks, “Why does the mind wander even when one wishes to concentrate?” Nâgasena replies with an analogy: “Majesty, as the wind bends a tree’s branches though the tree desires stillness, so the untrained mind is shaped by habit. Training and insight are the roots of stability.”

In another discussion, Milinda asks, “What makes a wise ruler different from an ordinary man?” Nâgasena answers: “A wise ruler, Majesty, sees consequences before they ripen. As a farmer recognises storms on the horizon, the ruler discerns danger in its beginning. The ordinary man sees only when the flood has already risen.”

These exchanges highlight qualities absent in contemporary politics: humility, intellectual urgency, and the ability to examine one’s own assumptions. The text repeatedly employs metaphors to illuminate causal complexity.

When the king asks why results do not always appear immediately, Nâgasena replies: “Majesty, a fruit tree does not bear fruit at the moment of planting. Its conditions must ripen. So too with actions: their results arise when causes come together.” This principle—conditionality—offers a lesson modern policymakers often ignore. Outcomes depend on numerous interlocking factors; hasty interventions usually produce unintended harm.

Menander’s engagement with Buddhism was not merely decorative. Historical evidence suggests he earned unusual respect for a foreign king, and later Buddhist tradition even describes him renouncing his throne for contemplative life. Classical sources offer two endings to his story: one claims he died while campaigning and that his ashes were divided among several cities, while another Buddhist account says he abandoned royal life, lived as a renunciant, and passed away in contemplative retreat.

One cannot forget that the true Buddha’s teaching encourages questioning, urging individuals to examine ideas through reflection, experience and reason rather than blind acceptance. The Kalama Sutta warns against accepting teachings simply because they are ancient, revered, or widely repeated. The Buddha advises, “Do not go upon tradition, nor scripture, nor hearsay; but when you know for yourselves that something is wholesome, undertake it.” That spirit of scrutiny underpins the Milinda Pañha. Nâgasena repeatedly urges the king to test ideas for himself rather than accept them on faith. Imagine if governments operated in this way: policies examined not for optics but for actual consequences, ministers interrogating not opponents alone but also their own assumptions.

The parallels with Greek philosophy deepen this point. Socrates famously insisted that true understanding begins with recognising one’s ignorance. Menander, though a king, behaves exactly in this spirit. His authority becomes irrelevant within the dialogue. What matters is the pursuit of clarity. This distinction—between power and truth—has nearly disappeared in modern politics, where charisma or inherited office is often treated as a substitute for competence.

The Milinda Pañha demonstrates that deep inquiry is inseparable from ethical leadership. Questions about the self, impermanence, responsibility, and causality are not abstract diversions; they shape how a ruler thinks about law, punishment, social welfare, and public duty. Without this reflective foundation, political systems decay into precisely what we see in many Buddhist-majority nations today: corruption, bureaucratic excess, and institutions more invested in pageantry than in moral purpose.

Modern leaders, whether Buddhist or not, might find in Menander and Nâgasena an urgently needed model. It is not the ceremonial connection to Buddhism that matters, but the intellectual discipline the text illustrates. A Milinda-inspired polity would prioritise careful questioning, ethical reasoning, and awareness of long-term consequences. It would distinguish the symbolic from the substantive. It would recognise that governance, like a chariot, is held together not by any single part but by the integrity of the whole. Without these missing links—without humility, enquiry, and ethical imagination—can today’s rulers move beyond the hollow performance that has replaced genuine leadership?
