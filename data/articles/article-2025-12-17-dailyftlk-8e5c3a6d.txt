Govt. urges media responsibility amid confusion over recent weather systems

Cabinet Spokesperson and Mass Media Minister Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa yesterday issued a strong appeal to the media and the public to act responsibly and avoid spreading confusion over recent weather events, including the Cyclone Ditwah, warning that misinformation risks undermining the country’s recovery efforts at a critical moment.

Clarifying speculation surrounding the sequence of weather disturbances, he said public discourse had wrongly conflated multiple, unrelated atmospheric systems.

“Although attention was drawn to atmospheric disturbances on 23 and 24 November, this report states that the possibility of a low-pressure area forming was mentioned only on 25 November,” Dr. Jayatissa said, stressing that timelines and technical facts must be respected.

He explained that Sri Lanka experienced disturbed weather conditions between 13 and 18 November, which evolved only into a low-pressure area before dissipating without escalating further. Subsequently, a separate system, Cyclone Senya, developed around the 26 and 27 November and affected Malaysia, Indonesia and islands including Sumatra.

Cyclone Ditwah, he stressed, formed only after the 24 November and was an entirely different weather event.

“Mixing these three systems together, using voice clips from different occasions and statements from meteorologists to create a misleading picture is unacceptable,” Dr. Jayatissa said.

He warned that such actions, whether deliberate or not, inflict damage on a country already struggling to recover from disaster.

The Cabinet Spokesman said distorted narratives erode public confidence not only in the Department of Meteorology and the professional expertise of its officials, but also in the broader State mechanism engaged in relief, reconstruction and coordination with international partners.

He cautioned that misinformation creates distrust at a time when the international community is extending support to help Sri Lanka rebuild. “These wrong narratives harm the country that is struggling to recover from a disaster,” he said, appealing to refrain such actions.

Dr. Jayatissa noted that over the past two to three weeks, authorities have consistently provided explanations based on verified data and facts.

He said that those who believe otherwise are free to seek legal redress. “If you want to take this to Court, then tackle this issue in Court, those who edited news, spread false reports, and misled the public can all be brought before the judiciary,” he said.

The Minister also revealed that several media institutions have already been formally informed about shortcomings in reporting. He reminded media organisations of their responsibilities, noting that they operate using public frequencies and rely on public trust. “If there was any shortcoming in your reporting, do not carry it forward, act responsibly for the sake of the country,” he urged.

Dr. Jayatissa further expressed concern over attempts by some commentators to draw parallels between recent weather events and the 2019 Easter Sunday attacks, suggesting this was fuelling unnecessary suspicion and fear. “That is why they keep referring to the 25 November,” he said, reiterating that the Government has already presented the necessary data to clarify all outstanding questions.

“The Government’s message is clear – accurate reporting grounded in verified information is essential to maintaining public confidence and ensuring that national recovery efforts are not derailed by misinformation,” he stressed.
