Sri Lanka Insurance supports 1000 families in flood-affected areas

Sri Lanka Insurance Life and Sri Lanka Insurance General, in collaboration with the National Disaster Relief Services Centre (NDRSC), extended vital assistance to 1,000 families affected by the recent ‘Ditwah’ cyclone. The relief initiative was carried out in two phases on 30 November and 2 December 2025, reflecting the company’s continued commitment to supporting communities in times of distress.

Dry ration packs were distributed through the NDRSC to the Maharagama Urban Council and the Divulapitiya Pradeshiya Sabha, ensuring that aid reached the most affected households swiftly and efficiently. Both distribution programs were held with the participation of local authorities and the management teams of SLIC Life and SLIC General, further strengthening the company’s close partnership with the communities it serves.

Sri Lanka Insurance Chairman Nusith Kumaaratunga said; “Sri Lanka Insurance has always placed community wellbeing at the heart of its purpose. In difficult times such as these, it is our responsibility to stand with the families who have been affected and offer meaningful support. This relief effort reflects our ongoing commitment to uplift communities and reinforces our role as a trusted national insurer focused on protection, care, and compassion.”

In addition to the relief program, Sri Lanka Insurance has implemented extended operating hours at selected SLIC General branches in the affected areas to ensure uninterrupted service. Claims, customer care teams, and branch staff are working beyond regular hours to provide prompt assistance to policyholders impacted by the severe weather conditions.

Sri Lanka Insurance remains dedicated to safeguarding its customers and supporting communities across the nation, reaffirming its longstanding promise of protection, stability, and service excellence.
