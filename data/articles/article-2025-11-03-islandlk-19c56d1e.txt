Sri Lanka hosts IFALPA “Positive Safety Culture” workshop, strengthening regional and international aviation safety collaboration

The Airline Pilots’ Guild of Sri Lanka (ALPGSL), in collaboration with the International Federation of Airline Pilots’ Associations (IFALPA), successfully hosted the Positive Safety Culture Workshop on 23rd and 24th October, 2025, at the Civil Aviation Authority Auditorium, Katunayake.

The two-day programme brought together 23 aviation professionals from Sri Lanka, India, and Australia, including representatives from the Civil Aviation Authority of Sri Lanka, SriLankan Airlines, FitsAir, Cinnamon Air, Air India, and Qantas. It was the first time all major local and international aviation stakeholders, operating in Sri Lanka, gathered under one roof to share experiences and strengthen the culture of safety across the region.

Facilitated by Capt. Helena Cunningham and Capt. Lucy Evans of IFALPA, the course explored practical approaches to building a strong and sustainable safety culture. Sessions covered topics such as psychological safety, managing sub-cultures within organisations, techniques for measuring safety culture, and fostering collaboration across operational environments.

The Positive Safety Culture Course, jointly offered by IFALPA and the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore, is recognised globally for helping aviation professionals move beyond compliance and build proactive, trust-based safety systems.

Following the conclusion of the programme, Capt. Suchithe Malawikankanamge, President, Airline Pilots’ Guild of Sri Lanka, commented:

“This workshop marks an important milestone for Sri Lanka’s aviation community. Seeing regulators, local carriers, and international airlines such as Air India and Qantas working side by side reflects a genuine commitment to safety and professional growth. It reinforces our vision of positioning Sri Lanka as a hub for regional aviation training and leadership.”

The initiative follows resolutions made at the IFALPA Asia West Regional Meeting in January 2025, where Sri Lanka was identified as a regional centre for aviation development and knowledge sharing.

The ALPGSL extends its gratitude to the Civil Aviation Authority of Sri Lanka for hosting the event and to IFALPA for its continued partnership in advancing global aviation safety standards.
