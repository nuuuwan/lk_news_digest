Minister sees red over landslide warnings

Agriculture Minister K.D. Lalkantha yesterday voiced sharp concern over the continued red-level landslide alerts in Kandy, saying the lack of clearance from the National Building Research Organisation (NBRO) is stalling basic recovery work and planning.

He warned that, with risks still elevated in multiple locations, authorities are being forced to contemplate options as drastic as relocating communities.

He said officials in the district cannot move ahead with restoration because the NBRO has not yet confirmed that conditions are stable. More than 20 areas in Kandy remain under a Level 3 red warning, the highest category issued by the NBRO, with similar alerts affecting Kegalle, Kurunegala, and Matale.

Lalkantha noted that while some agencies had discussed reopening schools, those same buildings may instead have to accommodate additional evacuees if conditions deteriorate. He said eight teams are currently operating on the ground, with the possibility of deploying more.

He added that the Government has examined the option of requesting international assistance, but that decisions on relocation, the continued use of schools as shelters, and the resumption of routine activities all depend on clear guidance from technical authorities.

“We cannot shift entire administrative divisions,” he said, noting that specific high-risk areas have been identified for priority action. He also underscored the need for divisional coordination committees to convene frequently, alongside district-level bodies, to manage the expanded workload linked to post-disaster recovery.
