Dialog Axiata reports robust growth and improved profitability in YTD 2025

Dialog Axiata PLC has announced a period of strong financial performance and strategic progress for the nine months ended 30th September 2025. The Group demonstrated significant earnings growth and cash flow generation, underscoring a successful recovery and operational efficiency.

Financially, the Group reported a 6% year-to-date (YTD) increase in revenue to Rs. 133.1 billion, with core revenue – excluding the strategically scaled-down low-margin international business – growing a robust 18% YTD. Profitability saw a dramatic improvement, with EBITDA surging 40% YTD to Rs. 62.9 billion. This drove the EBITDA margin to 47.3%, an expansion of 11.3 percentage points, which the company notes surpasses pre-crisis levels. Consequently, Net Profit After Tax (NPAT) more than doubled to Rs. 14.9 billion and Operating Free Cash Flow increased by 92% to Rs. 37.1 billion.

Performance across subsidiaries was mixed but positive. The core Mobile entity (the Company) remained the dominant contributor, with its NPAT growing over fourfold. Dialog Television posted higher revenue and EBITDA, though it remained loss-making at the net level. Dialog Broadband Networks saw a revenue decline due to the downsized wholesale operations, but its focused strategy led to a 51% growth in NPAT.
