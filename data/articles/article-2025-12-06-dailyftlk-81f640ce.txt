Cross-party Opposition MPs visit cyclone-hit Kandy district

A cross-party group of Opposition MPs recently visited the Kandy District, the area hit hardest by the recent extreme weather.

The MPs joined ongoing relief efforts, met with Government officials, and inspected the landslide site in Mawathura, Ihalagama, Gampola. Of the 35 people reported missing, only about 22 bodies have been recovered so far. Residents say the Government has done nothing to support the search and excavation, forcing the community to raise their own funds and bring in private machinery to retrieve the remains.

They also pointed out that there are several other affected locations where Government staff haven’t even shown up, leaving families to fend for themselves in the middle of a tragedy.
