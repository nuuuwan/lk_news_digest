Sofia Colombo launches City’s first multilingual ‘Hotel E-Shop’

Sofia Colombo has introduced Colombo’s first multilingual Hotel E-Shop, developed in collaboration with Thineth Software Solutions. This innovative digital platform allows guests to instantly access the hotel’s luxury services via a simple QR code scan – no app download or personal data required.

The E-Shop enables visitors and local patrons to explore and book premium offerings directly from their devices, including signature spa treatments, curated dining experiences, and exclusive souvenirs. Designed for seamless usability, the platform provides personalised recommendations, special offers, and smooth checkout.

By extending its hospitality beyond the physical premises, Sofia Colombo enhances guest convenience while supporting real-time service innovation through an integrated digital ecosystem.
