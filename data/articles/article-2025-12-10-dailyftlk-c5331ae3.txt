UK announces £ 1 m in humanitarian support for cyclone-affected communities in Sri Lanka

Acting British High Commissioner visits Red Cross operations in Gampaha to see UK aid in action

The Acting British High Commissioner to Sri Lanka Theresa O’Mahony, visited the Sri Lanka Red Cross Society’s centre in Gampaha District on 8 December to meet communities affected by Cyclone Ditwah and witness UK-funded humanitarian relief efforts in action.

As part of the UK’s initial response to the disaster, the Government has announced £ 1 million ($ 1.3 million) in humanitarian support for affected communities. This funding will help deliver emergency supplies and life-saving assistance to those who need it most.

During her visit, the Acting High Commissioner toured the Red Cross warehouse where UK aid supplies are being prepared for distribution, met with volunteers coordinating relief efforts, and travelled to flood-affected areas to speak directly with impacted families.

Beyond direct funding, the UK is a major contributor to international humanitarian partners working in Sri Lanka, including the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and the Asian Development Bank, both of which have allocated millions of dollars to disaster relief operations in the country.

The Acting High Commissioner was joined in Gampaha by IFRC Head of South Asia John Entwistle and received a briefing from Sri Lanka Red Cross Secretary General Dr. Mahesh Gunasekara on the ongoing relief efforts. The delegation also observed IFRC operational support at a temporary medical camp during the visit.

Acting British High Commissioner to Sri Lanka Theresa O’Mahony said: “I’ve seen here in Gampaha today that many families are facing grief and uncertainty; our support is about helping people get back on their feet—safely and with dignity. The UK stands shoulder to shoulder with the people of Sri Lanka, and we continue to work with the Government of Sri Lanka, the Red Cross, the UN and local partners today and in the months ahead, to help in the recovery efforts.”
