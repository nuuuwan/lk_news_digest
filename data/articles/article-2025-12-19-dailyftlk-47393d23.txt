Deep Tec Engineering expands to uplift rural Sri Lanka through sustainable water and solar solutions

Deep Tec Engineering Ltd., a pioneering force in sustainable water solutions, is reaffirming its commitment to transforming rural communities through innovative and environmentally conscious technologies.

Today, Deep Tec holds an industry-leading 28% market share in solar water pumps, underscoring its technical excellence and strong customer trust. The company also delivers nearly $ 2 million worth of solar water pump projects annually in collaboration with international development agencies, including the United Nations, the World Bank, and other global partners.

These long-standing collaborations highlight the company’s proven capability, transparency, and alignment with international sustainability and community-development priorities.

Over the past decade, the company has expanded its footprint across the island, enabling thousands of families and farmers to access life-changing water resources for drinking, agriculture, and livelihood development. Deep Tec’s unique model integrates advanced solar power technologies to ensure that rural water systems operate efficiently, affordably, and without dependence on fossil fuels or grid electricity. This commitment to sustainability has placed the company at the forefront of Sri Lanka’s green engineering movement.

Deep Tec’s success is driven by the leadership and vision of its Managing Director, Thilina Hettiarachchi, whose passion for uplifting rural Sri Lanka has shaped the company’s culture and mission. Hettiarachchi has been widely recognised for his contribution to social engineering and rural development. Most recently, he was named Best Entrepreneur of the Year 2025 at the Iconic Awards 2025, an accolade that reflects his dedication to expanding access to water, empowering farming communities, and championing renewable energy adoption across the country.

“Access to water is a fundamental human right, and our goal has always been to ensure that even the most remote communities receive this basic necessity in a sustainable manner,” Hettiarachchi said. “We believe renewable energy is not just a technical solution. It is a pathway to dignity, economic stability, and long-term resilience for rural Sri Lankans.”

As the demand for climate-resilient infrastructure grows, Deep Tec continues to invest in innovation, community engagement, and purposeful partnerships. The company aims to broaden its impact by scaling its solar water solutions, supporting national environmental goals, and enabling more rural families to thrive.

With a proven track record, strong leadership, and a clear social mission, Deep Tec Engineering stands poised to drive the next phase of Sri Lanka’s sustainable development—one village at a time.
