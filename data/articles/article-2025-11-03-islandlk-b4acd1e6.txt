Mark and Comm partners with Meridian Creative Solutions

Mark and Comm (Pvt) Ltd, Sri Lanka’s leading boutique public relations (PR) and communications agency, has formed a strategic partnership with Meridian Creative Solutions, extending the agency’s unified offering that addresses the full spectrum of modern brand building, from reputation strategy to technical execution.

The collaboration brings together Mark and Comm’s 14+ years of strategic communications, brand positioning, crisis management, corporate affairs and media relations expertise with Meridian’s capabilities in custom software development, UI/UX design, and digital ecosystem architecture, addressing a critical market gap where brand narrative and digital capability remain disconnected.

“Brand reputation and digital infrastructure are no longer parallel tracks. They’re interdependent,” said Thanzyl Thajudeen, Managing Director of Mark and Comm. “Organizations need platforms that embody their narratives, systems that deliver on brand promises, and digital experiences that reinforce positioning. This partnership delivers that continuity.”

Mark and Comm brings to the partnership its established reputation for PR-led ideas and strategies, alongside its international network spanning the GlobalCom PR Network’s 100+ countries, PRCA APAC corporate membership, and non-exclusive affiliations with leading global agencies.
