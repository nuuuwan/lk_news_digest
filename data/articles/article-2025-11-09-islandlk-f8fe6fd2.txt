A message of hope on the move: Kangaroo Cabs drives breast cancer awareness

In a unique awareness campaign this October, a simple taxi ride became a vehicle for a life-saving message. Kangaroo Cabs, one of Sri Lanka’s leading transport providers, turned its entire fleet into moving reminders for Breast Cancer Awareness Month by adorning its headrests with distinctive pink ribbons.

Each ribbon was paired with a QR code, allowing passengers on thousands of daily journeys from airport pickups to intercity travel to instantly access vital information about the importance of early detection directly on their phones.

“We’re proud that a simple taxi ride could carry a message that matters. A pink ribbon has gone a long way,” a spokesperson for Kangaroo Cabs said, noting the positive feedback received from passengers and drivers alike.

The company stated that by merging the daily commute with a critical cause, they demonstrated how awareness can travel seamlessly into the community, reinforcing that early detection is the most effective defence against breast cancer.
