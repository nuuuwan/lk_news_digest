ESOFT UNI unveils new Jaffna campus, strengthening access to higher education across Northern Sri Lanka

ESOFT UNI (ESU) marked a major milestone in its national expansion with the inauguration of ESU Jaffna reinforcing ESOFT UNI’s long-standing commitment to advancing higher education in the Northern Province, where it has been a pioneer for more than 15 years.

Established in 2009 on Navalar Road, Jaffna, ESOFT Metro Campus Jaffna has supported thousands of students through Diploma and Higher National Diploma (HND) pathways in providing more accessibility for education in the region. Today, as it transitions into ESOFT UNI, the Jaffna campus expands its academic portfolio across Information Technology, Business Management, Engineering, Hospitality Management, and Languages, supported by modern labs, internationally aligned curricula, and strong global affiliations. As Sri Lanka’s only Pearson Platinum Partner, ESOFT UNI, in collaboration with London Metropolitan University and Kingston University, allows students in the Northern Province to pursue internationally recognised degrees without having to leave their region.

Commenting on the launch, Dr. Dayan Rajapakse, Chairman and Group Managing Director of ESOFT Metro Campus and ESU, stated, “When I first started ESOFT Metro Campus in Jaffna over 15 years ago, I saw both the incredible potential of our youth and the heavy burden on parents who had to send their children away for advanced higher education. I believe that with ESU Jaffna, students will have the opportunity to pursue globally recognised, industry-relevant programmes close to home, without needing to relocate for such opportunities”.
