Sustainability is embedded in our DNA, and into how we operate, serve customers and plan for the future.

In addition to being honoured with the overall BCCS Award 2025, HNB was also placed among Sri Lanka’s Top 10 Corporate Citizens of 2025, based on the bank’s long-term sustainability strategy and structured Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) governance model.

The bank’s recognition under the Triple Bottom Line Awards – Economic Sustainability (Profit) and the dual honours for Economic Contribution – under both the Category Award for Best Performance and the Category Awards for Consistent Commitment and Continuous Improvement – Economic Contribution – further highlighted HNB’s consistent role in enabling enterprise growth, strengthening the financial system and supporting national development priorities.

Further cementing its leadership within the industry, HNB was also named Winner – Sector Award for Best Performance – Finance Sector, reflecting its sector-leading performance, governance standards and alignment with Sri Lanka’s broader sustainability objectives.

Meanwhile HNB’s pioneering ‘SOLO Podi Podi Business – women empowerment through digital literacy’ initiative was adjudged Winner – Best Project Sustainability Awards in recognition of its impact in supporting women micro-entrepreneurs through digital adoption, financial literacy, building improved resilience at the grassroots of the Sri Lankan economy.

Collectively, these accolades underscore HNB’s structured approach to sustainability, spanning environmental responsibility, social progress, financial inclusion, operational excellence and transparent governance. Through long-running community programmes, responsible lending frameworks and sustained investment in digital inclusion, the bank continues to set benchmarks as one of Sri Lanka’s foremost corporate citizens.
