ChildFund Sri Lanka mobilizes emergency response as catastrophic floods displace over 1.1 million

Sri Lanka is confronting one of its most devastating flood emergencies in recent history, with more than 1.1 million people seeking refuge in over 1,500 safety centres nationwide. The disaster has claimed 355 lives, with 366 persons still missing, as communities across multiple districts grapple with unprecedented destruction.

ChildFund Sri Lanka has launched a comprehensive emergency response programme, having verified the safety of 8,232 children supported through programs across affected regions. Current assessments reveal that 3,852 children are directly impacted by the floods, 440 have been displaced from their homes, and 2,452 remain unreachable due to severely damaged infrastructure and telecommunications blackouts affecting entire GN divisions.

The organization has activated Phase 1 emergency interventions across five priority districts, deploying LKR 15 million (approximately USD 49,000) to support immediate humanitarian needs. The response focuses on six critical areas: child protection and psychosocial support for traumatized children, education continuity programmes, distribution of child-sensitive non-food items, food security assistance, and provision of safe drinking water and WASH support.

“Protection concerns are escalating in overcrowded shelters, where children are showing visible signs of psychological distress,” said Aditi Ghosh, Country Director of ChildFund Sri Lanka. “Our teams are working around the clock despite breached reservoirs, cut-off communities, and @Senali we need to give the name of an appropriate person.

ChildFund Sri Lanka is actively participating in the national humanitarian response coordination, advocating for strengthened child-centred action alongside UN agencies, INGOs, and government partners. However, significant gaps in resources and access remain as the crisis continues to unfold.

The organization is urgently seeking additional support to scale up life-saving interventions for affected children and families. Priority needs include expanded psychosocial support services, emergency education materials, hygiene kits designed for children, nutritional assistance, and water purification systems for displaced communities.
