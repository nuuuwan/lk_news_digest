Financing issues seen as preventing households from benefiting fully from BESS-related tariff scheme

Ceylon Electricity Board ’s newly introduced feed-in tariff of Rs. 45.80 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) for rooftop and ground-mounted solar systems with battery storage — applicable to electricity exported to the grid between 6 p.m. and 10 p.m. — appears financially attractive at first glance. However, practical financing barriers may prevent most households from benefiting, according to an energy expert.

Under current conditions, a 5 kW rooftop solar-plus-battery system costing around Rs. 1.32 million could generate roughly 4,800 kWh annually during the evening period, earning about Rs. 220,000 per year. That translates to a simple payback period of about six years, or around seven to eight years when considering battery limitations, maintenance and occasional system downtime.

A long-term financial analysis also shows a positive Net Present Value (NPV). Assuming a 20-year system life, 10% discount rate, and annual operations and maintenance costs of Rs. 10,000, the total discounted benefit stands at approximately Rs. 1.785 million, resulting in an NPV of Rs. 465,000 — suggesting the investment is economically sound under ideal conditions.

However, the expert cautioned that real-world feasibility drops sharply when borrowing costs are included.

“The numbers look attractive on paper, but they don’t hold if you’re financing the system through a bank loan. At current interest rates of 15–18 percent, the simple payback can stretch well beyond ten years, the expert told The Island Financial Review.

They added that while the tariff aims to encourage power generation during peak evening hours — one of the Ceylon Electricity Board’s (CEB) biggest challenges — the lack of affordable financing options severely limits adoption.

“Battery-backed solar is a step in the right direction, but it will only reach its potential if concessional loans, tax relief, or special credit lines are made available. Without that, only a small segment of consumers will be able to invest, the expert noted.

Energy analysts agree that incentivizing night-time exports is critical for grid stability and reducing thermal power dependence. Yet, the success of the Rs. 45.80/kWh tariff will depend on the government’s ability to create an enabling financial framework for households and small businesses.

“If Sri Lanka wants real progress in rooftop solar with storage, the economics must work for ordinary consumers, not just large investors, the expert emphasized.

While the new tariff represents a bold move toward balancing supply and demand, access to affordable green financing remains the decisive factor that will determine whether battery-backed rooftop solar can truly power Sri Lanka’s energy transition.
