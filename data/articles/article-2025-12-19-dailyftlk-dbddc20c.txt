Varna Ltd., has achieved a landmark industry milestone, becoming the only flexible-packaging company in Sri Lanka to secure 10 national awards within a single year. The recognition spans four leading institutions – the CNCI Achiever Awards, FCCISL Entrepreneur of the Year, Chamber of Lankan Entrepreneurs and The Great HR Awards organised by CIPM —marking the strongest national performance by any organisation in the sector.

The achievement reflects Varna’s deep operational transformation, driven by sustained technology investment, upgraded manufacturing processes, modern leadership practices, and a strengthened people-first culture. These changes have positioned the company ahead of the wider flexible-packaging industry at a time when demand for sustainable packaging solutions, traceability, and export-ready quality standards continues to rise.

Varna Ltd., Managing Director Chamindra Gamage said: “These awards reflect the results of disciplined modernisation, empowered teams, and our commitment to lifting the benchmark for Sri Lanka’s flexible-packaging sector. Varna is focused on building a manufacturing ecosystem that is globally competitive, technology-driven, and prepared for the next decade of industry demand.”

Varna’s modernisation program included strategic investments in CI Flexo printing technology, new pouch-making systems, enhanced R&D capability, and stronger process discipline across its operations. According to the company, these measures have resulted in higher production efficiency, improved material performance, and a future-ready manufacturing model designed to meet elevated customer and industry expectations.

Varna’s performance comes as Sri Lanka’s FMCG and manufacturing sectors increasingly prioritise high-precision packaging, sustainability, and supply-chain reliability. As the most awarded flexible-packaging company in the country this year, Varna is positioned to expand partnerships with brand owners and manufacturers seeking world-class packaging solutions.

This transformation was strengthened by the consolidation of 98% ownership under Pursuit Investments, led by Managing Director Chamindra Gamage. The unified leadership structure has enabled faster decision-making, sharper strategy, and a clear long-term direction as Varna positions itself for global expansion and future-ready growth.
