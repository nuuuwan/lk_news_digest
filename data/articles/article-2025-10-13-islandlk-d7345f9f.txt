Chinese international trade promoter to bestow ‘Trusted Trader’ certification on eligible Lankan companies

For the first time, the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT) has decided to award the ‘Trusted Trader’ certification to Sri Lankan companies, following an initiative by the Sri Lanka–China Business Cooperation Council (SLCBCC).

This makes Sri Lanka the first country to adopt such a compatible system with China.

“Under this scheme, both Sri Lankan and Chinese companies will be recognized for their creditworthiness and sound commercial practices, said SLCBCC Senior Vice President Ranjith Laksiri.

“We will first update Sri Lankan companies with the requirements. Those that respond will be scrutinized, and the successful enterprises will be certified by the SLCBCC, he said.

The certification will then be ratified by the CCPIT’s Trade Development and Cooperation Centre in Beijing.

SLCBCC president Indika Salgado noted that around 150–200 Sri Lankan companies, mainly from the SME sector, are expected to be certified by mid-2026, enabling them to conduct business with Chinese companies with greater confidence and transparency.

Ajith Perera, chairperson of the Trusted Trader initiative, explained that the scheme will address payment issues that have hindered trade.

Currently, most imports from China are made through upfront telegraphic transfers, creating risks for SMEs. With the certification in place, both Sri Lankan and Chinese firms will follow improved commercial practices, ensuring smoother and more reliable payment systems.

“This will particularly benefit SMEs, many of whom were previously reluctant to engage with Chinese partners due to payment concerns, Perera said.

He added that the initiative was also endorsed by Sri Lanka’s Department of Commerce in 2021 at the Seventh China–Sri Lanka Joint Commission.
