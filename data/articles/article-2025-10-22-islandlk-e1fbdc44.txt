NDB Bank celebrates Sri Lanka’s pensioners on National Pension Day 2025

NDB Bank proudly joined hands as the Main Banking Partner for the National Pension Day 2025 celebrations, organised by the Public Service Pensioners’ Trust Fund Association on 10th October 2025 at the National Library Hall, Colombo. The event brought together over 600 pensioners from across the country, honouring the generations who have dedicated their lives to the nation’s service.

National Pension Day, observed annually on 8th October, stands as a moment of reflection and gratitude toward the country’s retired public servants, whose lifelong commitment and contribution have shaped Sri Lanka’s development and progress. NDB’s participation in this national event reflects the Bank’s enduring commitment to supporting and empowering senior citizens across the island.

At the heart of NDB’s offering for pensioners is the NDB Aachara Senior Citizens Account, a financial solution designed exclusively to serve the needs of senior citizens and pensioners. This account offers a suite of features that combine convenience, security, and meaningful returns, helping individuals in their golden years enjoy peace of mind and financial independence.

The NDB Aachara Loan Scheme, in particular, has been developed to provide much needed financial flexibility and security to retired individuals. The Aachara Loan Scheme offers loan facilities of up to Rs. 4.5 million, with a repayment period of up to 15 years, subject to a maximum age limit of 75 years. Every loan also comes with life insurance coverage, ensuring that in the unfortunate event of the borrower’s passing, the loan will be fully settled by the insurer, giving both the borrower and their family lasting peace of mind.

Speaking on the Bank’s participation, Sanjaya Perera, Senior Vice President – Personal Banking and Customer Experience at NDB, stated, “It is a privilege to celebrate Sri Lanka’s pensioners, those who have given so much to the nation, with meaningful financial solutions that truly serve their needs.
