Sri Lanka launches GEW 2025 with national unity and entrepreneurial spirit

Sri Lanka last week officially launched Global Entrepreneurship Week (GEW) 2025 under the inspiring theme ‘Together We Build,’ commencing a nationwide celebration of innovation, inclusion, and economic empowerment.

Global Entrepreneurship Week (GEW) is an annual worldwide movement celebrating innovators and entrepreneurs, promoting creativity, collaboration, and economic growth. This year, Sri Lanka continues the country’s engagement as part of the global network, with ICTA once again serving as the National Host Organisation.

‘Together We Build’ champions the initiative to unite Sri Lanka’s entrepreneurial ecosystem, empower communities, and drive sustainable growth through innovation. GEW 2025 unfolds countrywide, and Sri Lanka is poised to amplify its voice on the global stage, advocating creativity, resilience, and collaboration.

The launch was held at Temple Trees on 14 November  under the distinguished patronage of Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya. The event renewed Sri Lanka’s commitment to cultivate entrepreneurship as a catalyst for national development.

Supporting the entrepreneurial spirit around the nation, parallel launch events were simultaneously held throughout all nine provinces, within the first two hours of the Colombo ceremony, including the Prime Minister’s keynote address, live streamed to all provincial venues, guaranteeing inclusive participation from every corner of Sri Lanka.

Digital Economy Deputy Minister Eng. Eranga Weeraratne said: “Global Entrepreneurship Week Sri Lanka 2025 is a celebration of innovation and collaboration. By empowering entrepreneurs in every province, we are building the foundation for a digitally driven, inclusive economy where every Sri Lankan has the opportunity to create, connect, and grow. For the first time, we are launching Global Entrepreneurship Week simultaneously across all nine provinces ensuring that innovation is not limited to Colombo but embraced at every corner of our island. True progress happens when opportunity reaches everyone.”

Chief Adviser to the President on Digital Economy and ICTA Chairman Dr. Hans Wijayasuriya,

delivered the welcome address. GEN Global Representative Suresh de Mel, also spoke.

A special segment titled, ‘Empowering the Future: The Gig and Digital Economy’ showcased impactful private sector partnerships and financial empowerment initiatives for startups and SMEs. The panel discussion ‘The 2035 Playbook: How Sri Lanka Builds Its Next Era of Entrepreneurs’ focused on partnerships, innovation, and startup growth.

A thematic video screening captured the energy of GEW 2025 and previewed district-level activities, were followed by closing remarks, a media briefing, and networking.

The GEW Sri Lanka 2025 launch extended from ceremonial to an activated movement. It heralded a nationwide mobilisation. This year, the initiative is targeting rolling out 900 events throughout the country in all 25 districts. The campaign aims to onboard 250 partners and engage over 30,000 participants countrywide, creating an unprecedented entrepreneurial engagement in Sri Lanka.

To achieve these ambitious targets, national partners joining the campaign include Vidatha, NEDA, SED, IDB, NYC, and NYSC. Notable, many other partners have already joined the movement demonstrating strong support.

The launch aims to strengthen Sri Lanka’s innovation and startup ecosystem, building a platform connecting entrepreneurs, investors, academia, and government. The initiative also ensures entrepreneurship opportunities reach grassroots level, with district-level committees working alongside ICTA to coordinate activities and engage local communities. The program will engage students, startups, and business leaders through workshops, forums, and innovation showcases.
