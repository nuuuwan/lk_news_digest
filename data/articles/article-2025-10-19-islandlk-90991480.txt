Mintpay partners with FitsAir to make outbound travel more accessible

Mintpay, Sri Lanka’s premier payments platform, has partnered with FitsAir, Sri Lanka’s first privately owned international airline, to offer customers flexible and rewarding payment options when purchasing air tickets.

With this collaboration, customers can split their ticket cost into three interest-free instalments using Pay Later, or opt for Pay Now and receive 3.65% Instant Cashback on each ticket. The integration is designed to enhance the booking experience with greater affordability and convenience for its growing customer base, while also helping FitsAir drive higher conversion, increase average order value, and strengthen customer loyalty.

Mintpay Chief Operating Officer, Urmila Chandrasekaram, commented: “At Mintpay, we are always looking for ways to add value for our customers by expanding the range of experiences and products they can access. Our partnership with FitsAir marks the next step in this journey, unlocking air travel as a new way for customers to use Mintpay and explore foreign destinations.”

FitsAir Executive Director, Ammaar Kassim, stated: “At FitsAir, our focus has always been affordable, on-time, hassle-free travel. Partnering with Mintpay extends that promise of giving passengers greater flexibility and ease at checkout whilst making travel more accessible as we continue to redefine air travel in Sri Lanka and beyond.”
