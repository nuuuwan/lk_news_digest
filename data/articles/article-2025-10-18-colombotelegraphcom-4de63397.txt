Harini’s India Visit: Rekindling Neighbourhood Ties & The Promise Of People Centred Diplomacy

Prime Minister, Dr Harini Amarasuriya’s official visit to India (16–18 October 2025) was more than routine diplomacy. It was an act of rediscovery, a deliberate effort to reignite what may be called the neighbourhood charm between Sri Lanka and its long-standing friend across the Palk Strait. In many ways, India-Sri Lanka relations can be compared to the so-called “special relationship” between the United States and the United Kingdom, not because the power equations are the same, but because of the cultural intimacy, historical memory, and easy familiarity that bind two unequal partners with centuries of shared experience.

Unlike the trans-Atlantic friendship, this one has its roots deep in Asia’s civilizational soil. Sri Lanka’s history is as old as its mythology; it reaches back to the time when the Buddha’s teachings crossed the seas, took root, and gave the island a moral and cultural identity. Whether one reads the Mahāvaṃsa as fact or legend, it remains a living narrative of how people from the Indian subcontinent migrated to the island, mingled with the indigenous Vedda population, and gave rise to the Sinhala and Tamil civilization. The ancient exchanges of people, goods, ideas, and faiths, established a relationship that long predates both modern nations.

Separated by a narrow strip of sea yet united by a thousand invisible threads, India and Sri Lanka have always stood like two cousins in the same family. The sea, far from being a wall, symbolizes respect, a natural recognition of difference combined with closeness. From King Devanampiya Tissa’s correspondence with Emperor Ashoka to the arrival of Arhat Mahinda and Sanghamittā carrying the Bodhi Tree, India’s presence in Sri Lanka’s origin story is both spiritual and political. Largely, the hegemonic discourse of state sovereignty, though challenged by other narratives, establishes that the Bodhi Tree at Anuradhapura and the Sacred Tooth Relic remain the most powerful emblems of Sri Lanka’s statehood, legitimacy, and continuity, gifts that came across the waters from India.

Even in modern times, despite moments of political tension, from cricketing rivalries to the tragic years of war, the affection of ordinary Sri Lankans toward India has never died. Buddhist pilgrims yearn to visit Bodh Gaya, Hindu Tamils maintain sacred and familial ties with South India, and across all communities, there is an instinctive love for Bollywood, Kollywood, Tollywood, and Bengali cinema and music enjoy widespread admiration across Sri Lanka. These are the emotional arteries of the relationship, the rhythm that keeps it alive beyond diplomacy.

It is within this living heritage that Dr Amarasuriya’s visit must be placed. Her trip to India was not merely an official exchange but a homecoming. Having studied Sociology at Delhi’s Hindu College in the early 1990s, she returned now as Sri Lanka’s Prime Minister, a scholar-turned-leader reconnecting with the land that helped shape her worldview. Hindu College welcomed her as one of its own; she planted a sapling on campus and recalled her days among classmates and teachers in those formative years. “My years in Delhi taught me as much about life as about books,” she said, reminding us that diplomacy begins where human memory and education intersect.

During her visit, Dr Amarasuriya met Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and senior officials, exploring cooperation in education, innovation, and sustainable development. Modi welcomed her warmly, noting, “Our discussions covered a broad range of areas, including education, women’s empowerment, innovation, development cooperation and the welfare of our fishermen. As close neighbours, our cooperation holds immense importance for the prosperity of our two peoples as well as the shared region.” Dr Amarasuriya, in turn, said, “It was very good. We discussed how we can continue to maintain the good relations that we have established. Prime Minister Modi gave me quite a few ideas about the education reforms that are going on here. We discussed our respective policies.” On the sensitive issue of fishermen, she added, “That is an ongoing issue and something that needs to be discussed. We need to protect the livelihoods of our fishermen as well, but we understand that that’s a sensitive issue and we will continue to talk about it.”

Her itinerary also included visits to IIT Delhi and model schools where she studied India’s education reforms first-hand. She proposed a “Delhi–Colombo Education Bridge” for teacher exchanges, vocational training, and digital learning. One Indian official remarked that her visit “reflected the shared belief that education is the foundation of progress and partnership.” This emphasis on knowledge, capacity-building, and youth linkages marks a shift away from purely trade or defence-centred diplomacy.

However, in today’s world, sentiment alone cannot carry a foreign policy. While the civilizational connection between the two countries remains unbreakable, their relationship must also be read within the strategic grammar of the Indian Ocean. The region has once again become a theatre of global rivalry. China’s growing presence, the U.S.’s renewed interest, and the competition for influence among middle powers make South Asia a delicate balance of cooperation and contest.

Sri Lanka’s location, at the centre of vital sea lanes linking the Persian Gulf and East Asia, gives it a strategic weight far beyond its size. For India, a rising power-seeking regional stability and maritime security, friendship with Sri Lanka is not optional; it is essential. For Sri Lanka, maintaining India’s confidence is equally vital, for no small state in the Indian Ocean can navigate external pressures without a stable regional anchor.

This is where the cultural bond becomes not merely sentimental but strategic. Unlike military alliances or purely transactional pacts, cultural familiarity builds trust that survives regime changes and diplomatic storms. It cushions tensions and keeps dialogue alive when politics fail. Culture, in other words, is the deepest form of diplomacy. As Dr Amarasuriya’s visit revealed, a smile, a shared memory, or a visit to an old campus can often achieve more than a joint communiqué.

The analogy with the U.S.–U.K. partnership now finds fuller resonance. Just as Britain and America sustain a special relationship through shared values and institutions, India and Sri Lanka can sustain theirs through shared civilizational ethics, of compassion, learning, and coexistence. But unlike the trans-Atlantic world, where hard power dominates, South Asia’s peace rests on soft power and cultural empathy.

In the current geopolitical moment, this approach is refreshing. The world expects Sri Lanka to play a delicate balancing act between great powers. Previous governments often oscillated between over-reliance on one side and mistrust of another. The Dissanayaka and Amarasuriya government, however, appears to pursue a more confident, people-centred foreign policy. By placing education, knowledge, and cultural cooperation at the heart of diplomacy, it shifts the focus from dependency to partnership.

Her visit thus served two purposes. It strengthened ties with India at a critical time and projected a new foreign-policy temperament, one grounded in humility, intellect, and emotional intelligence. She demonstrated that diplomacy lies not in grandstanding but in listening, learning, and building trust. Of course, challenges remain. The Tamil Nadu fishermen issue, concerns about external influence, and strategic competition in the Indian Ocean will continue to test the relationship. Yet what makes this diplomacy different is the tone. Instead of threats and deals, she speaks of trust, dialogue, and mutual growth. And I would say, there cannot be relations without tensions and there cannot be tensions without relations.

For Sri Lanka, seeking India’s warmth is therefore not an act of submission but of strategic wisdom. The warmth of India, cultural, spiritual, and civilizational, offers Sri Lanka a shield against the cold calculations of great-power politics. For India, nurturing Sri Lanka’s trust is equally essential, for no regional power can claim leadership without the affection of its neighbours.

In the final analysis, Dr Harini Amarasuriya’s visit to India was not just a diplomatic journey but a reaffirmation of who we are as a region. It reminded both nations that friendship is not born of treaties alone but of shared memories, values, and destinies. As she aptly put it, “Ours is not a relationship of convenience but of conviction.” That conviction, grounded in education, culture, and empathy, may well be Sri Lanka’s most powerful foreign-policy asset in the years ahead. If nurtured wisely, it could become the very charm that keeps the Indian Ocean peaceful, plural, and open.
