Why the Proposed Amendments to Sri Lanka’s Universities Act Raise Fears of Authoritarianism, Democratic Backsliding, and a Dangerous Precedent for Academic Freedom

Sri Lanka’s university system has entered a moment of profound uncertainty as the National People’s Power (NPP) government advances a series of amendments to the Universities Act No. 16 of 1978. These changes, presented with unusual speed and minimal public discussion, have alarmed academics, administrators, and members of the Federation of University Teachers’ Associations (FUTA). While the government maintains that these amendments are intended to modernize higher education governance and introduce merit-based leadership structures, many within the academic community view them as a direct threat to university autonomy and a dangerous precedent for political interference.

The amendments, particularly those revising how Deans of Faculties and Heads of Departments (HoDs) are appointed and removed, have triggered deep anxiety among intellectual circles who fear that the proposed law signals an authoritarian shift rather than progressive reform. The sense of betrayal is especially pronounced because university teachers and intellectuals were among the strongest supporters of the NPP movement during the recent political transformations in Sri Lanka.

At the centre of the controversy are proposed revisions to Sections 49(1) and 51(1) of the Universities Act. These revisions expand the pool of academics eligible to contest for the position of Dean. Under the existing structure, Deans must be elected by the Faculty Board from among the current Heads of Departments or the former Dean. This ensures that only individuals with administrative experience and recognition within their faculty stand for the position. However, the new amendment widens eligibility to include Senior Professors, Professors, Associate Professors, and even Senior Lecturers Grade I.

Although on the surface this appears to broaden opportunities and allow for greater openness, academics argue that it in fact destabilizes long-standing governance structures and exposes the selection process to political influence. Expanding eligibility without strengthening administrative criteria, leadership experience requirements, or safeguarding against external interference creates an environment where politically backed individuals could easily bypass traditional academic merit.

Yet the expansion of eligibility is not the most contested element. What has shocked academics across Sri Lanka is the new provision empowering University Councils to remove Deans without any formal inquiry, disciplinary process, or due procedure. The Council, which includes several members directly appointed by the Minister of Education, is now given the ability to remove a democratically elected Dean purely on the basis of its internal vote. Such sweeping power is unprecedented in the history of Sri Lankan higher education. Under the current framework, any removal from office must follow established disciplinary protocols, including issuing charges, conducting inquiries, and allowing for defence and appeal. Eliminating these safeguards fundamentally undermines the principle of natural justice. Deans would become vulnerable to political pressure, personal vendettas, institutional politics, and ideological conformity expected by whoever influences the Council majority.

Many academics fear that this provision is not aimed at improving governance but at consolidating political authority over universities. Sri Lanka has a long history of political meddling in higher education, particularly in the appointment of Vice Chancellors. Recent events at some Public Universities where the University Grants Commission abruptly cancelled nominations for Vice Chancellor without transparent justification have been cited as a clear example of the politicization already occurring under the present administration. When the UGC, a supposedly independent regulatory body, acts in ways that reflect political pressures, academics reasonably fear that granting Councils unchecked power to remove Deans will worsen the trend. The arbitrary removal of a Dean could easily become a tool for control: those who express dissent, resist political directives, or support student movements might be dismissed simply because they do not align with the prevailing political agenda.

The speed with which the NPP government has introduced these amendments has amplified suspicion. Stakeholders were not consulted. Faculty Boards, University Senates, academic unions, and even experienced administrative leaders were excluded from discussions. No white paper was circulated. No formal invitation for comments was issued. Despite the NPP’s public commitment to transparency, inclusiveness, and “system change,” the process surrounding these amendments contradicts every democratic principle the party claimed to champion. Federation of University Teachers Association (FUTA), usually open to policy dialogue, has openly condemned the amendments and questioned why such sweeping changes are being rushed without proper consultation. The irony is not lost on academics: prominent members of FUTA have previously held high national office, including the Ministry of Education and even the post of Prime Minister. For a government linked to former academic activists to ignore the voices of academic institutions feels especially insulting. For many academics believes, this amendment is not simply a legal misstep but it is also direct assault on the dignity, autonomy, and democratic traditions of Sri Lankan universities.

Beyond the legal and political dimensions, academics are deeply concerned about the cultural and institutional consequences of these changes. University leadership thrives on internal democracy. Deans and Heads of Departments are expected to operate independently, ensuring that academic decisions from curriculum development to student welfare are based on scholarly principles rather than government agendas. If Deans can be removed without reason, the effect will be chilling. Administrators may hesitate to challenge questionable directives or resist political pressure for fear of losing their positions. Academic freedom, already fragile in Sri Lanka, could deteriorate rapidly. Research agendas may shift toward safe, apolitical topics. Public commentary by academics could become muted. Students, too, may suffer indirectly as universities become more risk-averse, less critical, and more obedient to political authority.

The threat to fundamental rights is tangible. Removing a Dean without inquiry violates principles of natural justice, which guarantee individuals the right to know the charges against them, the right to respond, the right to a fair and impartial investigation, and the right to appeal.

These principles are cornerstones of administrative law and are embedded in democratic governance. Circumventing these procedures essentially creates a parallel system where academic leaders are treated as political appointees rather than elected representatives of their faculties. Such a shift would place Sri Lankan universities in the company of authoritarian or militarized higher education systems elsewhere in the world, not among democratic nations where university autonomy is protected by statute.

Furthermore, the long-term implications for Sri Lanka’s academic reputation are severe. Internationally, strong higher education systems rely on clear separation between government influence and academic leadership. In Australia, the United Kingdom, Canada, and many European nations, Deans and Heads of Departments cannot be removed by politically influenced councils without due procedure. Decisions of this nature require transparent evidence, independent panels, and documented disciplinary processes. By contrast, the amendments proposed in Sri Lanka resemble governance structures found in autocratic regimes, where political loyalty often trumps academic merit. This perception could discourage international collaborations, visiting professorships, and global partnerships. It may also affect accreditation pathways, research funding opportunities, and the ability of Sri Lankan institutions to compete on the global academic stage.

The academic community has warned that Sri Lanka already faces severe challenges relating to brain drain, low research investment, and institutional instability. Political interference will only accelerate the exodus of skilled academics who seek environments where independent thought and professional dignity are protected. Many have expressed that they would rather accept lower salaries abroad than remain in a system where their professional integrity is at risk. Young academics, too, may hesitate to pursue careers in Sri Lankan universities if leadership positions become subject to political manipulation. This could eventually weaken the country’s capacity for scientific innovation, policy research, technological advancement, and knowledge production at a time when Sri Lanka desperately needs a robust intellectual workforce.

The cultural consequences of these amendments extend beyond academia. Universities play a critical role in shaping national consciousness. They nurture critical thinking, foster debate, and provide a space for young people to question power. Weakening university autonomy indirectly strengthens authoritarian governance throughout society. If academic voices are subdued, public policy will lose one of its most reliable sources of informed critique. Citizens, too, will feel the effects as public discourse becomes narrower and more controlled. The erosion of intellectual independence in universities often signals the early phases of broader democratic decline. Sri Lanka, still recovering from economic crisis and struggling to rebuild public trust in institutions, cannot afford such regression.

For their part, the government has defended the amendments by claiming that the changes will improve accountability, expand merit-based opportunities, and eliminate ambiguous language in the existing Act. While their concerns about ambiguity and governance shortcomings may be valid, critics insist that the solutions proposed are disproportionate and destructive. Expanding eligibility for Deans might be reasonable if accompanied by strengthened administrative criteria, leadership training programs, transparent performance assessments, and independent oversight mechanisms. But none of these appear in the amendment bill. Instead, the government has introduced a removal mechanism that undermines every principle of due process and opens the door for political abuse. This raises a deeper question: if the objective truly is meritocracy, why remove the procedural safeguards that prevent unjust dismissals?

Even academics who are supportive of the NPP’s broader political agenda are uneasy. They emphasize that reform should not be undertaken in isolation or without community consensus. Universities are not merely state institutions; they are intellectual communities governed by collegial principles. Any reform affecting their leadership structures must arise from meaningful dialogue with those who understand the complexities of academic life. Senior professors note that university leadership cannot be improved simply by widening eligibility. True leadership requires experience, respect among peers, and an appreciation of academic culture, qualities that cannot be legislated into existence, especially not through rushed amendments. Many fear that the government sees universities through a bureaucratic lens rather than understanding the unique intellectual, cultural, and administrative ecosystem in which academic governance operates.

A particularly troubling argument raised by academics concerns what the amendments could mean for the future. Laws once passed remain in force far beyond the lifespan of any government. Even if the NPP claims benign intentions today, future administrations especially those with authoritarian tendencies could easily exploit these amendments to exert control over universities. Sri Lanka’s history provides countless examples of laws enacted for one purpose being used for another. The Prevention of Terrorism Act, for instance, was introduced as temporary emergency legislation but evolved into a tool for political suppression. Granting Councils the power to remove Deans without due process could become a similar mechanism in the hands of future governments. For academics, the question is not only what the NPP intends but what any future government might do with these expanded powers.

The sense of urgency within universities is palpable. Many academics argue that the government must immediately pause the parliamentary process surrounding the amendments and engage in genuine consultation. This includes involving FUTA, the UGC, university Senates, legal experts, student unions, former Vice Chancellors, and professionals with administrative experience. A comprehensive review should be conducted to identify governance gaps in the current system, determine whether changes are warranted, and develop reforms that enhance both autonomy and accountability. The academic community is not opposed to reform but it insists that reform must strengthen democracy, not weaken it.

In this context, the amendments are seen not only as legally flawed but morally troubling. They undermine the trust that academics placed in the NPP government, a trust built on promises of transparency, consultation, and respect for institutional independence. For a party that campaigned on ending authoritarian governance, introducing amendments that empower political appointees to remove elected academic leaders is deeply inconsistent.  Academics now fear that this may signal a broader trend: that the government’s commitment to system change does not extend to safeguarding democratic principles within state institutions.

Sri Lanka stands at a crossroads. The amendments to the Universities Act are more than administrative adjustments; they are a test of the government’s commitment to democratic governance. If passed without modification, they risk undermining academic freedom, silencing critical voices, and enabling political interference in spaces that must remain independent. Universities have long been centres of intellectual resistance, social critique, and democratic activism. Weakening their autonomy will weaken Sri Lanka’s democratic fabric. A government seeking to build a more just, equitable, and educated society cannot begin by constraining the freedom of its universities.

These amendments to the internal academic administration structure proposed by the NPP government violate long-standing democratic values that safeguard academic freedom and independent thinking. Within the Commonwealth tradition, academic integrity policies emphasize honesty, trust, fairness, and responsibility principles that guide the behaviour of students, faculty, and administrators alike. These policies condemn any form of dishonesty, including fraud, plagiarism, misrepresentation, or abuse of authority, and insist on transparent processes, clear rules, and consistent enforcement to ensure a trustworthy academic environment. By contrast, reforms that enable arbitrary appointments or removals of academic leaders without due process undermine these foundational values. They weaken the institutional culture of responsibility and transparency, and erode the safeguards that have historically protected academic communities from political interference. In this context, such amendments not only threaten academic governance but also contradict the very principles of integrity and accountability upheld across the Commonwealth’s higher education systems.

The academic community has repeatedly warned that Sri Lanka is already grappling with serious challenges in the smooth functioning of universities, the retention of qualified academics, and growing institutional financial instability. In the aftermath of Cyclone Ditwah an event that has further crippled the nation’s economic resilience, Sri Lanka can ill afford additional turmoil within its higher education sector. If universities are pushed into authoritarian administrative structures and governance chaos, the consequences could be devastating. Such disruptions risk accelerating intellectual flight, weakening academic institutions, and ultimately destabilizing the entire nation in the months and years to come. In this fragile national context, undermining universities is not merely an academic issue it is a national crisis in the making.

The path forward requires humility, reflection, and dialogue. The government must acknowledge the concerns raised by academics, pause the amendment process, and commit to a consultative approach that respects the knowledge and experience of those who have dedicated their lives to education and research. Only through meaningful engagement can Sri Lanka develop reforms that genuinely improve higher education governance while preserving its democratic values. The stakes are high. The future of Sri Lanka’s universities and by extension, the future of its democracy depends on the decisions made today.
