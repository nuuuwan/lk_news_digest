Rebuilding Sri Lanka With Purpose

Sri Lanka’s latest natural disaster – Cyclone Ditwah – once again exposed deep structural weaknesses not only in disaster preparedness but also in governance economic resilience and regional connectivity. Amid this crisis India’s response stood out for its speed scale and restraint.

India’s immediate humanitarian assistance extended across the entire island was not merely a gesture of goodwill. It reaffirmed India’s Neighbourhood First policy and its commitment to regional stability. More importantly India’s early intervention encouraged other countries to step forward with rescue support and essential supplies at a moment when Sri Lanka was already economically and institutionally weakened.

For many Sri Lankans this response reinforced a simple reality. India is not only a close neighbour or strategic partner but a reliable humanitarian presence in moments of national distress.

However relief alone cannot rebuild a nation. Sri Lanka now stands at a critical juncture where post disaster recovery must transition into long term economic and political reconstruction.

As Sri Lanka moves beyond the immediate relief phase the focus must shift towards connectivity trade and investment led recovery. In this context cooperation between India and Sri Lanka including engagement with the current National People’s Power government becomes crucial.

Two long delayed projects in the Northern Province merit urgent attention not as regional concessions but as national economic enablers.

The development of Kankesanthurai Harbour has remained stalled for decades despite its strategic value. Properly developed KKS can function as a regional maritime gateway linking Sri Lanka with South Indian and broader Asian ports.

Such connectivity would strengthen trade logistics facilitate passenger movement reduce pressure on Colombo centric infrastructure and generate economic activity in the North while contributing to national GDP. This is not a Northern project. It is a national connectivity asset.

Jaffna International Airport represents an immediate opportunity for economic revival if approached pragmatically. A first stage of regional connectivity linking Jaffna with nearby Asian destinations particularly India can unlock rapid tourism inflows diaspora engagement employment generation and quick GDP uplift.

In parallel second stage upgrades should proceed to accommodate larger aircraft. This will enable exports of high value and perishable goods such as seafood and fresh produce strengthen foreign exchange earnings and integrate Northern producers into regional supply chains.

Infrastructure and investment alone are insufficient. Sri Lanka’s experience shows that economic recovery without inclusive governance remains fragile.

The long standing political aspirations of the Tamil people centred on dignity land rights and meaningful participation in governance cannot be indefinitely postponed under the cover of emergencies or economic crises.

India’s position on this issue has remained consistent over decades. Support for devolution within a united Sri Lanka democratic provincial governance and constitutional frameworks that protect minority rights are foundations for stability.

Sustainable recovery requires public confidence. Confidence cannot be built where democratic processes are delayed devolved institutions remain inactive or political questions are indefinitely deferred.

Natural disasters do not erase constitutional commitments. They should not be used to delay democratic processes. Instead they should compel political maturity.

Sri Lanka now has an opportunity to align humanitarian recovery connectivity driven economic growth and inclusive governance. India has demonstrated leadership during the emergency phase. The next phase should focus on constructive engagement that supports rebuilding both infrastructure and institutional trust.

Recovery should not mean returning to old failures. It must mean choosing a better path.
