“Maldivians with Ceylon” telethon extended as donations hit Rs. 255 m

The “Maldivians with Ceylon” telethon was extended till 2 p.m. yesterday after drawing an overwhelming nationwide response to support Sri Lanka, which is facing severe destruction, displacement and fatalities caused by heavy rains linked to storm Ditwah. Public Service Media announced the extension to allow more citizens and institutions to contribute.

The telethon began at 9 a.m. on Sunday morning and was initially scheduled to end at 1 a.m. However, donations surged throughout the day as State institutions, Government-owned companies, private sector firms and members of the public rallied behind the cause, prompting organisers to extend the duration.

According to the latest update, the telethon had now raised MVR 11,015,854.65 and $ 48,681.31, which amounts to about Rs. 255 million in total contributions for Sri Lanka.

This marks one of the most significant humanitarian mobilisations in the Maldives, underscoring the deep and longstanding ties between the two countries.

Donations remain open in both currencies through QR payments, cash, cheques, bank transfers and collection boxes placed across Malé, Hulhumalé and Villimalé.

With the extension in place, the “Maldivians with Ceylon” telethon continues to unite communities across the Maldives in a powerful show of solidarity during Sri Lanka’s time of need.
