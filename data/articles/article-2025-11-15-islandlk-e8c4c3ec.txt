LTL Transformers (Pvt) Ltd was recognized as an Award Winner at the Sri Lanka National Quality Awards (SLNQA) 2023 under the Manufacturing (Medium) Category, at the ceremony held yesterday at Cinnamon Lakeside, Colombo, organized by the Sri Lanka Standards Institution (SLSI). The SLNQA is the nation’s highest recognition for organizational excellence, modeled on the globally acclaimed Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award (MBNQA) framework of the USA. The award evaluates organizations through seven key categories – Leadership, Strategic Planning, Customer Focus, Measurement, Analysis and Knowledge Management, Workforce Focus, Operations Focus, and Results—reflecting a holistic approach to performance excellence.

Through consistent achievements across these pillars, LTL Transformers demonstrated a robust, data-driven management system rooted in quality, innovation, and continuous improvement. This accomplishment reflects the company’s strong leadership, customer-centric strategies, and commitment to sustainable operational excellence.

Following its national success, the company also achieved global recognition as a “World Class Winner” at the Global Performance Excellence Awards (GPEA) organized by the Asia Pacific Quality Organization (APQO), further cementing its position as one of the region’s most progressive and quality-driven engineering companies.

Beyond awards, LTL Transformers continues to advance Sri Lanka’s industrial strength by manufacturing high-efficiency, low load-loss Amorphous Transformers and Renewable Energy Transformers that support global clean-energy transitions. These transformers deliver significant reductions in carbon emissions, improved energy efficiency, and meet stringent international performance standards.

By exporting these world-class products engineered by Sri Lankan talent, the company not only strengthens Sri Lanka’s international credibility but also saves valuable foreign currency for the country, reinforcing the importance of local manufacturing capability in a competitive global market.
