Ranil to convene party leaders to discuss next steps after Ditwah

Ex-President Ranil Wickremesinghe has taken steps to convene all party leaders to discuss the steps to be taken in the face of the adverse situation that faces Sri Lanka following Cyclone Ditwah.

All party leaders are scheduled to meet at the Ex-President’s Political Office on Flower Road tomorrow.

United National Party Chairman Vajira Abeywardena said that the steps to be taken in the future will be decided at the party leaders’ meeting, following discussions based on the experience gained in successfully facing previous natural disasters under Ranil Wickremesinghe’s leadership.

Abeywardena said that Ranil Wickremesinghe is expected to brief party leaders at this meeting on the steps taken during the floods of 2003 and 2016 and the post-flood period. “This is the first time that all political party leaders in and outside Parliament are being convened in one place after this natural disaster,” he said.
