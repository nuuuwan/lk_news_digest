CHEC Port City Colombo deploys disaster-response fleet to restore A5 corridor

The A5 Kandy to Nuwara Eliya road is a critical transport route heavily damaged by Cyclone Ditwa

In response to the urgent need to restore access to communities affected by Cyclone Ditwah, CHEC Port City Colombo Ltd. swiftly deployed its full fleet of disaster-response machinery within 24 hours of pledging support, the President’s Media Division said.

A total of 12 heavy-duty machines, including excavators, backhoes, loaders, and transport trucks, along with a skilled technical team, have been dispatched to the Central Province to accelerate road clearance, slope stabilisation, and infrastructure recovery.

The operation focuses on the A5 corridor from Kandy to Nuwara Eliya, a critical transport route severely affected by the cyclone, where supply lines were disrupted and emergency responders faced challenges accessing impacted areas.

This follows the company’s Rs. 10 million contribution to the Government’s ‘Rebuilding Sri Lanka’ Fund, with an additional Rs. 3 million raised and donated by the Port City Colombo project management team and CHEC Limited’s regional office to support ongoing relief efforts.

The company has also provided specialised technical expertise for emergency bridge repairs, road reconstruction and engineering assessments to aid the Government’s broader recovery operations.
