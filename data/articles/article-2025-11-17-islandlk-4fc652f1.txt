Chairs and tables … to the fore!

An ungainly sight seems to have cropped up in the entertainment scene with certain artistes using chairs, and also tables, to perform (sing and dance) at public events.

One must remember that chairs are for sitting and tables are for guests to have their meals.

The question being asked by many is whether these chairs and tables are cleaned, after improper use, so that the guests present can feel comfortable using them?

There should be a limit to what singers can do to project themselves while performing.

It’s certainly jarring to see performers using furniture in ways it is not intended for, especially when it’s a public event.

At Oktoberfest, however, dancing on benches (not chairs) is a common sight and part of the festive atmosphere; dancing, and singing along to traditional German folk songs, and having a blast, but dancing on tables is not allowed.

I’m told that security guards are quick to intervene if someone climbs on a table, as it poses a risk of knocking over drinks or hurting someone.

If this is not nipped in the bud, we may even see artistes walking on tables, encouraging those seated at the table, to sing along with them!
