In a significant international accolade for Sri Lanka’s tourism sector, the Sun Siyam Pasikudah resort was awarded ‘Luxury Beachfront Retreat of the Year’ at the prestigious Global Peace Hospitality Summit & Awards 2025 in Dubai.

The award recognises the resort’s excellence in “mindful luxury and sustainable tourism,” highlighting Sri Lanka’s growing profile in the global peace-led hospitality market.

The event also served as a major triumph for the Maldivian-based Sun Siyam Group and its Founder & Chairman, Ahmed Siyam Mohamed. Siyam was the ceremony’s most decorated individual, receiving three top honours: the Golden Sail of Distinction and two Lifetime Achievement Awards for Hospitality & Service Excellence and Entrepreneurship & Business Innovation.

The awards celebrated his pivotal role in developing the Maldives as a world-class destination and his decades of work in national development and philanthropy.

Beyond the Pasikudah win, the Sun Siyam Group’s portfolio was recognised with six major awards, cementing its status as a leader in sustainable luxury. The other winning properties are located in the Maldives and include Siyam World, Sun Siyam Vilu Reef, Sun Siyam Iru Fushi, Sun Siyam Iru Veli, and Sun Siyam Olhuveli.

The summit, hosted by the Global Peace Institute (UK) under the theme “Peace Through Hospitality,” gathered over 200 leaders from 46 nations. The accolades underscore the Sun Siyam Group’s successful strategy of combining business excellence with sustainability and social progress.
