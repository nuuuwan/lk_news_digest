The strong growth in EU markets and the positive cumulative performance reflect the industry’s resilience, ongoing investments in competitiveness, and our commitment to meeting the needs of international buyers. Sustained market diversification and consistent policy support will be essential as we work to build on this momentum in the months ahead.”
