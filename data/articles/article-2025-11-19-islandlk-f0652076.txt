CSE: JF Packaging’s stellar debut eclipsed by broader market slump

Colombo Stock exchange (CSE) presented a tale of two extremes yesterday, as the stellar debut of newly listed JF Packaging failed to offset a broader market slump. While the stock became the day’s highest turnover contributor, the CSE overall recorded its lowest turnover for the fifth consecutive day, with both key indices retreating amid continued pressure.

Amid those developments both indices moved downward. All Share Price Index down by 21.80 points while S and P SL20 down by 15.18 points. Turnover stood at Rs 3.8 billion with seven crossings. Those crossings were reported in CIC Holdings 2.5 million shares crossed to the tune of Rs 83.3 million and its share price traded at Rs 33.30, VallibelOne 700,000 shares crossed to the tune of Rs 73.5 million and its share price traded at Rs 105, Hemas Holdings 1.6 million shares crossed to the tune of Rs 58 million and its share price traded at Rs 35.20, Haylays 200,000 shares crossed to the tune of Rs 39 million and its  share price traded at Rs 195, Renuka Foods 650,000 shares crossed to the tune of Rs 23.7 million and its share price traded at Rs 30.50, hZenid 1.2 million shares crossed to the tune of Rs 21.6 million and its share price traded at Rs 18 and JKH 880,000  shares crossed to the tune of Rs 20 million and its share price traded at Rs 22.80.

In the retail market top seven companies that have mainly contributed to the turnover were JF Packaging Rs 424 million (27.4 million shares traded), CIC Holdings Rs 236 million (seven million shares traded), JKH Rs 189 million (8.4 million shares traded), Sampath Bank Rs 124.9 million (853,000 shares traded), hZenid Rs 110 million (6.1 million shares traded) and HNB (Non-Voting) Rs 108 million (331,000 shares traded).
