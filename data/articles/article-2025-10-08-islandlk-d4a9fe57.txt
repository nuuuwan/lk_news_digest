Carmart unveils Leapmotor C10 to combat EV range anxiety

One of the greatest concerns consumers have about choosing an electric vehicle is range anxiety from running out of charge, especially in a deserted area. Carmart provided a solution to this with the Leapmotor C10 REEV (Range Extender EV) – an electric SUV that doesn’t need to be plugged in and charged.

The C10 SUV can be used like a normal EV around town yet has the flexibility of being able to travel up to 1150km, thanks to its built-in generator that recharges the battery while on the move.

Leapmotor is supported in Sri Lanka by Carmart, the exclusive Peugeot importer and authorized repairer for over 75 years, and backed globally by Stellantis, Europe’s second-largest carmaker; and home to 15 brands including Peugeot and Maserati – whose engineers fine-tuned the C10’s suspension to give it a premium feeling drive.

Consumers can experience Leapmotor models alongside their Peugeot counterparts at the newly renovated Stellantis Brand House concept showroom on Union Place, Colombo 2 – the first of its kind in the South Asian region.

The C10 blends sleek design with everyday practicality. A spacious interior offers family-friendly comfort, advanced infotainment, and refined styling. Safety remains paramount, with a 5-star Euro NCAP rating covering adults, children, and pedestrians, supported by cutting-edge driver-assistance systems. Ownership peace of mind comes with an 8-year battery warranty and a 4-year/120,000 km vehicle warranty, with an extended warranty also available.
