AAIB assesses crop damage amid heavy rains

The Agricultural and Agrarian Insurance Board (AAIB) announced that it is actively assessing the impact of recent heavy rains on crops across the country, even as the 2025/26 paddy cultivation season begins with fields reported largely unaffected.

Although land preparation for the new paddy season has commenced, officials confirm that paddy cultivation lands are safe and no damage has been recorded so far. However, the Board is keeping a close watch on other crops covered under free insurance, including maize, onion, potato, soya and chilli, which may have been affected by the recent downpours.

AAIB Chairman Pemasiri Jasingharachchi said district officials are currently gathering detailed information from farmers to estimate the full extent of crop damage and are preparing relevant programs to provide relief.

“As per the Government policy, compensation for damage to paddy fields is paid at Rs. 100,000 per hectare, up to a maximum of five acres. For other insured crops such as maize, onion, potato, chilli and soya, free crop damage compensation is provided up to 2.5 acres,” he noted.

He stated that additional compensation is also available to farmers holding insurance coverage from the AAIB for affected crops.

Authorities continue to urge farmers to report any damage promptly to ensure timely assistance and support for affected communities
