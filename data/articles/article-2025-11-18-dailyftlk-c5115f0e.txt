Ceylon Chamber of Commerce and Gujarat Chamber of Commerce & Industry sign MoU

The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce and the Gujarat Chamber of Commerce & Industry (GCCI) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on 13 November in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, to strengthen bilateral trade, investment, and business cooperation between Sri Lanka and Gujarat.

The MoU was signed by The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce Chairperson Krishan Balendra and GCCI President Sandeep P. Engineer.

The signing took place during the visit of Sri Lankan High Commissioner to India Mahishini Colonne, marking her first official State-level engagement since assuming office.

The initiative and arrangements leading to the signing were facilitated by Sri Lanka’s Honorary Consul in Gujarat Rakesh Shah, whose efforts played a key role in bringing the two Chambers together.

Under the MoU, The Ceylon Chamber and the GCCI will collaborate to promote business opportunities, facilitate joint ventures and partnerships, organise business-to-business (B2B) engagements, and enhance knowledge sharing between the private sectors of both economies. It is hoped that the partnership would also serve to deepen maritime and logistics cooperation and build on the complementarities between Gujarat’s major ports and Sri Lanka’s role as a regional transshipment hub.

Both Chambers expressed confidence that the MoU will open new avenues for trade, investment, and sustainable economic cooperation.
