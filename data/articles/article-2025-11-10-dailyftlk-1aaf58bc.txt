Seven Sri Lankan drug traffickers abroad express willingness to surrender: Minister

Public Security Minister Ananda Wijepala yesterday revealed that seven Sri Lankan nationals involved in drug trafficking and currently hiding in Middle Eastern countries have indicated their readiness to surrender to local authorities.

The Minister made the disclosure, while participating in the Colombo District Operation held under the “Ratam Ekata” national anti-drug campaign at the Colombo District Secretariat.

Wijepala said the development marks a significant breakthrough in ongoing efforts to dismantle international drug networks linked to Sri Lanka.

He added that law enforcement agencies are coordinating with relevant foreign authorities to facilitate the safe return and legal processing of the suspects.

The Minister reaffirmed the Government’s commitment to intensify anti-narcotics operations both domestically and overseas, noting that the “Ratama Ekata” initiative aims to unify national efforts across multiple sectors to curb drug abuse and trafficking.
