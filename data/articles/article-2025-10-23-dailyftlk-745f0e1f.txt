Rs. 1 b worth illegal cigarettes turned into clean energy at Western Power’s Waste-to-Energy facility

In collaboration with Sri Lanka Customs and Ceylon Tobacco Company PLC, Western Power Company Ltd., a subsidiary of Aitken Spence PLC, facilitated the secure incineration of two large consignments of illicit cigarettes. Both consignments, which had been seized by Sri Lanka Customs, were destroyed at Western Power’s Waste-to-Energy (WtE) plant in Kerawalapitiya.

The first event comprised a total weight of 1,680 kilograms of illicit cigarettes. According to the Sri Lanka Customs and Ceylon Tobacco Company, the consignment contained an estimated 2 million cigarette sticks, with a potential market value exceeding Rs. 274 million. The entire volume was irreversibly incinerated using advanced waste-to-energy technology, ensuring that the illicit goods could not re-enter the market. This process generated over 714 kilowatt-hours of electricity, which was supplied to the national grid.

The second event comprised a total weight of 7,260 kilograms of illicit cigarettes. The consignment included approximately 5.5 million cigarette sticks, with an estimated market value of Rs. 852 million. This shipment was also completely destroyed using the same advanced waste-to-energy incineration process, guaranteeing irreversible destruction and preventing re-entry into the market. The process contributed to the generation of over 2870 kilowatt-hours of electricity, which was supplied to the national grid.

These initiatives underscore the Waste to Energy plant’s position as a trusted partner for Government and corporate stakeholders by delivering a secure, compliant, and sustainable solution for waste destruction. Through these processes, the plant prevents harmful substances from entering the environment, generates green electricity from waste, and supports law enforcement in eliminating illicit trade products.

Aitken Spence Power Sector Managing Director Leel Wickremarachchi said: “As a responsible energy partner, we are committed to supporting national efforts in curbing illegal trade. By safely incinerating this consignment, we not only helped prevent a significant loss to state revenue but also contributed to sustainable energy production. Our Waste-to-Energy plant will continue to serve as a vital resource in upholding environmental and regulatory standards in Sri Lanka.”

Western Power Company Ltd., operates Sri Lanka’s first and only Waste-to-Energy Power Plant, which has been converting non-recyclable waste into clean energy since its official launch four years ago. The 10 MW facility contributes electricity to the national grid—enough to power approximately 100,000 households—while playing a crucial role in responsible waste management.
