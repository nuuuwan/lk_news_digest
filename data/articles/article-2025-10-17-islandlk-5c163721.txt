LAUGFS Gas brings global glory to Sri Lanka for Marketing Excellence at WLGA 2025

LAUGFS Gas PLC has brought international recognition to Sri Lanka after being named the Winner of the Marketing Excellence Award 2025 by the World Liquid Gas Association (WLGA). The prestigious award was presented at the Liquid Gas Week 2025 Gala Dinner held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, marking a landmark achievement for Sri Lankan marketing on the global stage.

This international recognition celebrates LAUGFS Gas’s transformative social-impact initiative, “The Triangle of Change,” a purpose-driven campaign that connected marketing, empathy, and energy access to uplift communities and create lasting social transformation. Conceptualized and executed entirely by the in-house marketing team, the campaign addressed one of Sri Lanka’s most critical social and environmental challenges: the widespread use of firewood for cooking, which exposes millions of households to harmful indoor air pollution.

Built around a three-layer impact framework of Access, Awareness, and Education, the campaign delivered measurable and meaningful outcomes. Under the Access component, the Cylinder Donation Program “Project LIFE” distributed over 100 portable 5kg LPG kits to low-income families, providing a safe, affordable, and portable alternative to firewood while enabling cleaner, healthier cooking practices.
