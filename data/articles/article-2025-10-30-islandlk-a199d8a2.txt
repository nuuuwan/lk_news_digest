Connecting Rainforest Communities:

In a world grappling with climate change, biodiversity loss, and growing socio-economic inequalities, Sri Lanka is striving to chart a path that connects people, planet, and prosperity. This commitment was on full display at Genesis by Dilmah — a thought-provoking forum held in Colombo under the theme “Connecting Rainforest Communities and Livelihoods.”

The event brought together conservationists, academics, policymakers, and business leaders in a dynamic exchange on how to integrate biodiversity conservation with sustainable development. Among the keynote speakers were Senior Professor Hiranthi Ranasinghe, who delivered an insightful presentation on ecosystem services and biodiversity connectivity, and Dr. Dilhan C. Fernando, Chairman of Dilmah Tea, who underscored the moral and economic imperatives of sustainability-led business.

Professor Ranasinghe began by congratulating the organisers for convening what she described as “a landmark event” — one that brings science and sustainability together in action. “This is a leading scholarship,” she said, “not something abstract or ornamental. Ecosystem conservation is essential if we are to remain sustainable in this world.”

Her presentation centred on ecosystem services — the invaluable benefits forests provide, from water regulation and carbon storage to soil fertility, recreation, and cultural identity. “Forests act as storehouses of water, releasing and regulating it during dry seasons. They clean our air, nurture our soils, and provide education and recreation. These are the very foundations of human wellbeing,” she said.

However, she warned that these vital systems are under threat. “Our forests are fragmented by human activity — plantations, infrastructure, and encroachment. When ecosystems are divided, elephants, pollinators, and countless other species lose their movement corridors. Their vitality declines, and the entire ecological processes collapse.”

To address this, Professor Ranasinghe proposed biocorridors — natural connections linking fragmented rainforests. These corridors, she said, are crucial for maintaining ecological balance, enabling wildlife movement, and sustaining livelihoods.

“It’s not only about planting trees. It’s about reconnecting lives — of people, animals, and ecosystems. Restoration must deliver real benefits to local communities who become custodians of conservation,” she emphasised.

She praised ongoing community-driven initiatives where degraded lands are being restored, and local people trained and empowered. “Universities can provide science and technology, the private sector can ensure continuity and finance, and local communities can provide stewardship. Only together can we ensure long-term sustainability.”

Professor Ranasinghe noted that Sri Lanka has pledged to increase forest cover from 29% to 30% by 2030 — a goal aligned with the National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan and Nationally Determined Contributions under the Paris Agreement.

A key part of her message was the importance of Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) — a mechanism in which beneficiaries, such as industries and tourism operators, compensate communities for protecting forests and water sources. “It’s a win-win model,” she said. “Those who preserve the environment should be recognised and rewarded.”

Professor Ranasinghe also discussed climate finance and carbon credits as emerging opportunities for conservation funding. “Under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, nature-based solutions have gained prominence. Forest conservation and reforestation can attract investment through verified carbon credits — but the key lies in transparency and equitable benefit-sharing.”

She stressed that these mechanisms should never be purely transactional. “Carbon balance must translate to household balance. If a company pays for tree planting, that is good to start with, but unless communities gain long-term livelihoods from it, sustainability will remain elusive.”

“When forests connect, life thrives. When people connect with nature, sustainability begins.”

In a passionate address, Dr. Dilhan C. Fernando highlighted the urgent need to redefine the concept of value in business and governance. “When businesses and governments define what constitutes value, they are often far removed from reality,” he said. “We measure success in financial terms, ignoring the ecological and human wealth that underpins it.”

Dr. Fernando noted that Sri Lanka’s natural beauty is inseparable from its economic identity. “Would the Nine Arches Bridge stripped of its surrounding forest have the same appeal? Would Ceylon Tea taste the same without its mountain ecosystem? Absolutely not. Nature gives meaning and authenticity to our industries.”

He lamented that while global discussions on climate finance and sustainability have grown louder, action remains painfully slow. “We are long on thought, short on time, and short on impact,” he said, calling for businesses to embrace regenerative practices.

Dr. Fernando reaffirmed Dilmah’s founding philosophy of “kindness to people and nature.” He said, “We have an enduring connection with nature because it is nature that crafts our teas. We have an enduring connection with people because it is our community that brings quality and character to our products. For us, it is not corporate social responsibility — it is simply the right thing to do.”

He also linked sustainability to social justice. “The government is right to speak about increasing plantation workers’ salaries. But unless we create new value in tea, coffee, and cashew, we cannot sustain those wages. Extraction without investment becomes a new form of colonialism. We must focus on creating value, not just redistributing scarcity.”

As the forum concluded, a short documentary — Connecting Rainforest Communities — took the audience through the restoration efforts in the Anuradhapura region, where local communities, scientists, and private partners are working hand in hand to revive degraded lands and strengthen biodiversity corridors.

Professor Ranasinghe’s parting message summed up the spirit of the day:

“Protect what we miss, connect what was separated, and nurture what we will keep together.”

The Genesis by Dilmah forum reaffirmed that Sri Lanka’s future prosperity depends on how well it reconnects people with nature. From the mist-clad highlands to the tropical rainforests, the country’s green heritage is not just a symbol of beauty — it is the foundation of its resilience.

Because, as both speakers reminded us, when forests connect, livelihoods prosper, biodiversity flourishes, and life itself endures.
