CBL Foods International Ltd., a subsidiary of CBL Group, has been recognised with the Global Performance Excellence Award (GPEA) 2025 – Best in Class, presented by the Asia Pacific Quality Organisation (APQO) at its 30th International Conference held in Beijing, China.

The company was also honoured with the APQO International Best Practice – Silver Award at the same forum.

CBL Foods International Ltd., Chief Executive Officer Kamal Geeganage said, “Quality has always been our number one priority at CBL Group. It is the foundation of our reputation and trust. We never compromise on quality because every product that leaves our facilities carries the pride of our people and the promise of our purpose. As a company with humble Sri Lankan roots and a growing international footprint, we are proud to set benchmarks for the confectionery industry—proving that a Sri Lankan business can achieve and sustain world-class standards.”

The Global Performance Excellence Awards, organised by APQO, are the only formal international recognition for business excellence in the Asia-Pacific region. The awards promote the adoption of world-class quality and performance management practices and recognise organisations that demonstrate exceptional results in leadership, strategy, customer engagement, workforce development, and operational performance.

To qualify for this prestigious recognition, nominees must first be recipients of their respective National Quality Awards, a distinction CBL Foods International earned by winning the Sri Lanka National Quality Award 2023 in the Large-Scale Manufacturing category.

“At CBL, quality is not part of us—it is us. It defines how we think, create, and operate across the Group. It shapes the trust we build, the value we create, and the impact we deliver to every life we touch. Our commitment to quality is inseparable from our purpose, because creating enriching moments of happiness begins with doing things the right way, every time. That is what has built our legacy, and it is what will define our future,” said, CBL Group – Group Managing Director Shea Wickramasingha.

Guided by the CBL Group’s purpose of “Creating Enriching Moments of Happiness,” the company remains committed to driving excellence, innovation, and continuous improvement—setting new standards for Sri Lanka’s food manufacturing sector on the global stage.
