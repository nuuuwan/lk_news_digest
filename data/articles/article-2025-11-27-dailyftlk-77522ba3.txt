Award presented for Sri Lanka’s ‘Leading Hospital in AI and Innovation’

Nawaloka Hospitals has been honoured with the prestigious title of “Leading Hospital in AI and Innovation of the Year in Asia Pacific” at the GlobalHealth Asia Pacific Awards 2025, held in Athenee Hotel, Bangkok recently. This landmark recognition places Sri Lanka firmly on the global healthcare innovation map and reinforces Nawaloka’s leadership in adopting cutting-edge technologies to serve the nation.

This is the first time a Sri Lankan hospital has secured this coveted international title, underscoring Nawaloka’s groundbreaking efforts in transforming healthcare delivery through technology. The recognition was driven in large part by the hospital’s introduction of Sri Lanka’s first AI-powered Emergency Radiology Unit, a major leap forward in diagnostics and patient care.

“Nawaloka Hospitals has always been driven by a vision to elevate the quality of healthcare in Sri Lanka through innovation, excellence, and accessibility,” said Nawaloka Hospitals PLC Chairman Dr. Jayantha Dharmadasa.

“This award is a testament to our continued investment in next-generation technology and our unwavering commitment to delivering world-class care at an affordable price to the Sri Lankan public. We are proud to lead the way in setting new benchmarks for private healthcare in the region.”

The GlobalHealth Asia Pacific Awards recognise healthcare providers and companies that go beyond traditional service delivery to create exceptional patient experiences. Winners are selected through a rigorous judging process that includes in-depth interviews, consumer feedback across multiple touchpoints, and analysis of organisational performance and growth strategy.

Nawaloka’s AI-powered ER Radiology Unit, the first of its kind in the country, has set a new industry standard for diagnostics. The system enhances the speed and accuracy of critical diagnoses, particularly in emergency situations, offering patients quicker access to life-saving treatment. This technology-driven milestone reflects the hospital’s broader ambition to bring future-ready healthcare to Sri Lanka’s doorstep.

The award also acknowledges the strategic leadership and future-forward thinking that have driven Nawaloka’s transformation journey in recent years. With a focus on digitisation, patient-centric design, and operational excellence, Nawaloka continues to build a healthcare ecosystem that meets global standards while staying rooted in local needs.

The GlobalHealth APAC Summit, Conference & Awards 2025 serves as a dynamic platform that brings together industry leaders, innovators, and policymakers to exchange ideas, explore breakthroughs, and chart the course for the future of healthcare. Nawaloka’s recognition among such an elite group of healthcare institutions marks a significant milestone not only for the hospital but for Sri Lanka’s healthcare sector as a whole.

As healthcare systems across the Asia Pacific region adapt to the realities of a fast-evolving landscape, Nawaloka Hospitals’ success offers a powerful case study on how innovation, leadership, and customer focus can converge to drive sustainable growth and global recognition.
