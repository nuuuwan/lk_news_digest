Court upholds fair access for tourism operators in Samanalawewa

Eco Team Group, the pioneer of canoeing and kayaking in Samanalawewa, has welcomed a recent Court of Appeal ruling reinforcing fair and transparent access to the lake for all tourism operators.

In a statement, the company said the decision marks a significant milestone for Sri Lanka’s tourism industry, safeguarding equitable access to public natural resources while setting an important precedent for the sector.

Eco Team Group has been active in the Belihuloya area for years, employing more than 32 individuals from the Imbulpe and Balangoda electorates through its three establishments. “This long-standing collaboration has not only created livelihoods but also strengthened the local economy and social fabric of the region,” the company said.

The firm said that in recent years, access to Samanalawewa for tourism activities had become increasingly restricted under an arrangement lacking transparency and inclusivity, affecting several regional tourism operators and hoteliers. Despite multiple appeals at the regional level, no resolution was reached, prompting the company to seek legal redress.

In its interim order, the Court of Appeal directed that parties seeking to restrict access to Samanalawewa refrain from doing so. The court affirmed that the lake is public property, recognised Eco Team Group’s right to operate independently under the oversight of State authorities, and instructed the creation of a transparent mechanism to manage access and associated fees.

An Eco Team Group spokesperson said, “This ruling is of national importance, as it reinforces that Sri Lanka’s natural and tourism resources belong to the public and must remain accessible under the country’s legal framework. It underscores the importance of fairness, professionalism, and good governance in ensuring that community involvement empowers rather than excludes.”
