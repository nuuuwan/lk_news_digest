Migrant remittances rise to $ 695.7 m in Sept.

Notes $ 5.8 b total remittances during first nine months of 2025

The Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE) has announced that Sri Lanka’s foreign employment sector has recorded a significant increase with migrant remittances reaching $ 695.7 million in September 2025.

Citing statistics from the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, the SLBFE states that it is a year-on-year increase of $ 140.1 million, compared to $ 555.6 million recorded in September 2024.

During the first nine months of 2025, the country received a total of $ 5,811.2 million in remittances, reflecting a 16.65% growth from $ 4,843.9 million during the same period last year.

The SLBFE noted that foreign employment continues to serve as a key pillar of Sri Lanka’s economy, making a direct contribution to strengthening national foreign reserves. The Government, in collaboration with the SLBFE and other stakeholders, has taken significant steps at the diplomatic level to promote new overseas employment opportunities through a fair and efficient system.

A streamlined recruitment process has been introduced for job placements in Israel, Japan, and South Korea, while strict mechanisms are in place to curb fraudulent recruitment practices and safeguard the welfare of Sri Lankan migrant workers.

As the SLBFE celebrates its 40th anniversary this year, it continues to support the country’s economic stability and the welfare of the Sri Lankan expatriate community, working closely with licensed foreign employment agencies and international partners.

The Bureau expects migrant remittances to surpass $ 7 billion by the end of 2025, with an estimated 300,000 Sri Lankans projected to take up foreign employment this year.
