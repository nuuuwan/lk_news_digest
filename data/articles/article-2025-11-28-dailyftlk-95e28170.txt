Revello chocolates enter Bahrain

Sri Lanka Embassy facilitates CBL brand’s entry into the Kingdom

Says Sri Lanka-Bahrain trade strengthens, enhances visibility of Sri Lankan products

The Embassy of Sri Lanka in Bahrain yesterday said it has successfully facilitated the first ever introduction of Revello chocolates to the Bahraini market.

“This signals a significant step in strengthening commercial ties and paving the way for greater market access for Sri Lankan products,” it said in a statement.

Revello is a flagship product of CBL Foods International Ltd., one of Sri Lanka’s largest food manufacturing conglomerates with a strong global presence across chocolates, biscuits, confectionery and nutritious food.

The first consignment of Revello chocolates will be available from early December through the Lulu Hypermarket chain, one of Bahrain’s leading retail chains.

“This milestone enhances the visibility of new Sri Lankan products within mainstream Middle Eastern retail channels,” the Embassy said.
