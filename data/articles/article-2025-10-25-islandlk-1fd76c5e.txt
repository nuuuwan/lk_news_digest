End of Indian Maoists?

Five months to go, since the Home Minister Amit Shah, commonly known among hardcore BJP loyalists in Delhi as Modi’s Chanakya, promised the nation that by March 2026 India would be completely free from Maoist terror. It was not an offhand remark but a calibrated assertion—one that echoed through the ranks of India’s paramilitary forces and state police units spread across the dense jungles of Bastar, Bijapur, and Sukma.

The claim has since been repeated with ritualistic certainty in official briefings, as if the eradication of a 60-year-old insurgency could be reduced to a deadline. Meanwhile, last week brought a remarkable spectacle in Maharashtra: over two hundred Maoists, many with heavy bounties on their heads, surrendered in a choreographed display of contrition, their weapons neatly arrayed before television cameras. These men and women, once fugitives of the state, are now set to be redeployed—ironically—as auxiliaries to help vanquish those who refuse to yield. India’s long war with itself is entering its most paradoxical phase.

The story of the Maoist movement—once grandly envisioned as the “protracted people’s war”—is as much a chronicle of rebellion as of betrayal. What began in 1967 in Naxalbari, a small village in West Bengal, as an agrarian uprising inspired by Mao Zedong’s revolutionary template, metastasised over the decades into a vast subterranean network stretching from Andhra Pradesh to Bihar.

For much of the 2000s, the Communist Party of India (Maoist) exercised de facto control over territories larger than some European states, levying taxes, running kangaroo courts, and filling the vacuum left by indifferent governance. By 2010, the movement had reached its zenith—over 2,000 violent incidents were recorded that year, and more than a thousand lives were lost. The Indian state, in turn, responded with its own brand of counter-insurgency—part developmental, part punitive, and often extrajudicial.

The government’s current narrative—that Maoism is now a relic gasping its last—is not entirely untrue. According to official figures, only eleven districts are still affected, compared to 125 a decade ago. Yet this statistical triumph conceals an uncomfortable truth: the so-called decline of Maoism has less to do with ideological exhaustion and more with exhaustion of the people themselves. The forest communities, once sympathetic to the rebels’ rhetoric of land and dignity, have been crushed between two merciless jaws—the state’s militarisation and the insurgents’ obdurate violence.

The moral centre of the movement rotted when extortion replaced ideology, and purges replaced politics. The death of leaders like Kishenji and Azad, both of whom argued for negotiation, left behind a leadership too dogmatic to adapt and too compromised to inspire. But even as the Maoists faltered, the state often failed to rise above its own lawlessness.

The District Reserve Guard, or DRG, is perhaps the most controversial embodiment of this paradox. Born in 2015 as a locally recruited counter-insurgency unit, the DRG is made up of surrendered Maoists, victims of Maoist brutality, and tribal youth who know the terrain better than any outsider. Officials hail it as a “game changer,” a force that speaks the local dialects and understands the topography of fear. Yet the DRG is also a legal and moral quagmire. Many of its members admit to receiving little or no formal training, and their operations have repeatedly drawn allegations of extrajudicial killings.

Villagers from Bijapur to Sukma recount stories of midnight raids where unarmed men were dragged from their homes, accused of being Maoists, and shot dead. Some even tried to surrender but were executed instead. The 2011 Supreme Court ruling that forbade the state from recruiting locals as Special Police Officers seems to have been circumvented in all but name. The DRG’s existence symbolises a bitter irony: the state is using yesterday’s rebels to kill today’s rebels, perpetuating a cycle of vengeance that leaves the rule of law in tatters.

It is tempting to frame this as a success story—an insurgency in terminal decline, a nation reclaiming its sovereignty—but the ground reality defies such neat resolution. In villages once marked as Maoist “liberated zones,” new schools and roads have indeed appeared, but they often arrive under the shadow of military camps. For every kilometre of new tarmac, there is a checkpoint; for every new clinic, a curfew.

If the government proclaims victory, it must also confront the moral arithmetic of its campaign. Who accounts for the unacknowledged dead—the villagers mistaken for insurgents, the women widowed by “encounters,” the children orphaned by suspicion? The Home Ministry insists that allegations of fake encounters are minimal and unfounded, yet independent human-rights groups, and sometimes even internal reports, tell another story. The culture of impunity that surrounds these operations corrodes the very institutions it seeks to defend. When the state bends its own laws to crush those who defy it, what distinguishes justice from revenge?

Still, the surrender of ideologues like Mallojula Venugopal Rao, once the CPI-Maoist’s chief spokesperson, marks a tectonic shift. Rao, now 70, has denounced his former comrades as “Godi Maoists”—a biting neologism for those who claim revolutionary virtue while colluding with power. He accuses the Telangana State Committee of sabotaging peace and living off state leniency under an undeclared ceasefire. His confession is more than personal disillusionment; it is an indictment of an organisation that has devoured its own purpose. The ideological fractures within the Maoists—between the reformist bloc seeking dialogue and the hardliners clinging to a phantom war—mirror the broader dissonance between India’s revolutionary romanticism and its democratic reality.

Can Maoists, or their ideological heirs, survive within a democratic framework? History offers precedents that are both hopeful and sobering. In Nepal, the Maoists traded guns for ballots and briefly ruled the nation before descending into factionalism and corruption. In India, some ex-insurgents have found space in grassroots politics, especially at the panchayat level, where their organisational discipline translates into electoral capital. Yet for most, the transition from forest to forum is fraught.

The Indian political system, increasingly commercialised and personality-driven, leaves little room for ideological insurgents who lack wealth or patronage. Even if the Maoists were to renounce violence wholesale, would the political establishment genuinely accommodate them, or merely co-opt and neutralise them? The state’s rehabilitation schemes—offering money, jobs, and protection to surrendered cadres—address survival, not political agency. Integration without dignity is merely pacification.

The roots of the insurgency lie not in Marxist theory but in administrative neglect. Generations of Adivasis were dispossessed in the name of development, their forests commodified, their voices ignored. It was not China’s Mao but India’s own bureaucracy that drove them to rebellion. Successive governments, from Congress to BJP, have oscillated between apathy and aggression, seldom introspection. The Modi government’s strategy—part counter-insurgency, part developmental showcase—has certainly broken the Maoists’ military spine, but whether it has addressed the underlying grievances remains doubtful. The Forest Rights Act and the PESA Act, which promise self-governance and resource control to tribal communities, are still patchily implemented. If these structural injustices persist, the Maoists may vanish, but the resentment that birthed them will endure.

If March 2026 does arrive with the government’s promise fulfilled, it will be hailed as one of the biggest victories of Narendra Modi’s tenure. The Red Corridor will be history, the maps cleansed of insurgent stains. But the question that will linger is not whether the Maoists were defeated, but whether India has won anything of moral substance. Peace achieved through erasure is not peace; it is amnesia.

The forests may fall silent, yet beneath their quiet canopy lie unanswered questions—about justice, about dignity, and about a democracy that still struggles to listen to its poorest citizens. When the guns fall silent, India must decide whether it has ended an insurgency or merely buried its conscience.
