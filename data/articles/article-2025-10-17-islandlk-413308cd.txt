Lanka Ashok Leyland reports strong first half

Lanka Ashok Leyland PLC, a successful joint venture between the Government of Sri Lanka and Ashok Leyland Limited of India, recently announced robust financial results for the first half of the financial year ending September 30th, 2025. The company emphasized its strategic focus on developing the local industry through local manufacturing/ assembly with increased value addition and capitalizing on the nation’s economic recovery.

CEO of Lanka Ashok Leyland, Mr. Umesh Gautam stated, “We are proud of our strong first-half performance, with a profit of Rs. 1.17 billion and total revenue reaching Rs. 7.75 billion. This growth is a testament to our robust partnership with the Government of Sri Lanka and the valuable support from the Ministry of Industry. Our strategy of investing in local value addition is generating job opportunities for Sri Lankans, strengthening our domestic supply chain, and aligning perfectly with the government’s vision for economic progress.”

Gautam added that with the Sri Lankan economy advancing, the company is also addressing the government’s push to improve urban passenger transport. “In line with this vision, we are moving to relaunch our Ultra Low Floor AC buses. These 80 buses, originally introduced in 2013, were previously underutilized due to uneconomical operation.

We are now structuring an attractive financial package to incentivize private operators to deploy these vehicles in city operations.”
