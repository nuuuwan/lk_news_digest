Construction sector shares prove their investor attractiveness

The CSE kicked off on a positive note yesterday but later retail and institutional participation decreased due to investor pessimism on the country’s economic prospects. Despite those odds, investor confidence in construction rose due to country reconstruction efforts that began in the aftermath of the flood devastation coupled with construction sector companies’ 3rd quarter fortunes picking-up, market analysts said.

Amid those developments, mixed reactions were noted in both indices. The All Share Price Index went down by 6.15 points, while the S and P SL20 rose by 6.11 points. Turnover stood at Rs 2.35 billion with five crossings.

In the retail market companies that mainly contributed to the turnover were; Tokyo Cement (Non Voting), Rs 259 million (three million shares traded), Tokyo Cement (Voting) Rs 204 million (1.8 million shares traded), Colombo Dockyard Rs 101 million (528,000 shares traded), Renuka Agri Foods Rs 94.6 million (8.8 million shares traded), Hayleys Rs 72.3 million (372879 shares traded), East West Properties Rs 71.1 million (one million shares traded) and Access Engineering Rs 54.4 million (870,000 shares traded).
