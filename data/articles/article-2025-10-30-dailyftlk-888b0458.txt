New road safety, driver drug-testing laws to be tabled in Parliament

The Government has introduced two key directives under the Motor Vehicles Act aimed at enhancing road safety and curbing drug-impaired driving, with both measures to be submitted to Parliament for approval.

The Cabinet of Ministers on Monday approved two proposals presented by the Acting Minister of Transport, Highways, and Urban Development; one to formalise drug testing procedures for drivers suspected of narcotic use and another to make seat belts mandatory for all passengers traveling on expressways.

Under the newly issued Motor Vehicle (Drug) Directive No. 1 of 2025, published in the Extraordinary Gazette No. 2452/40 dated 4 September 2025, Police officers will now be legally empowered to refer drivers suspected of drug use to a Government medical officer for examination.

Previously, although the Motor Vehicles Act permitted such action, no clear procedure or threshold existed to determine the presence of drugs in a driver’s system. The directive establishes a formal framework for conducting such tests and verifying impairment levels, strengthening enforcement against drug-impaired driving.

Separately, the Motor Vehicles Directive (Expressway) No. 02 of 2011 has been amended by Gazette No. 2455/29 dated 25 September 2025, mandating seat belt use for every passenger occupying any seat in vehicles traveling on expressways. The measure comes amid rising concern over an increase in fatal and serious accidents on expressways in recent months.

“Both directives, one addressing driver impairment and the other focusing on passenger safety reflect the Government’s renewed commitment to reducing road accidents, improving public safety and ensuring stricter compliance with transport regulations against the rising road accidents,” Acting Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Vijitha Herath said at the weekly post-Cabinet meeting media briefing held on Tuesday.

When asked about motorists complaining on the soared seatbelt prices and shortage in the market ahead of the regulations coming into effect, he responded that both parties had sufficient time to import or fix the necessary equipment.

“I don’t think it’s a valid argument because the rule was announced three months ahead and both motorists and the spare parts importers had enough lead time to bring down and fix necessary equipment,” Herath added.
