Jagath Sumathipala leads Sumathi Holdings into solar power

Jagath Sumathipala, Chairman of Sumathi Holdings, leads the Group’s commitment to renewable energy with the commissioning of a 5-megawatt (MW) ground-mounted solar power plant at Wewila, Eheliyagoda. This marks Sumathi Holdings’ strategic entry into solar energy, following the success of the Sujala Shakthi Hydropower Plant, and reflects its long-term vision to support Sri Lanka’s transition to cleaner and more sustainable energy.

Initiated in 2024 and completed this year, the project was developed under Sumathi Energy Company (Pvt) Ltd, a subsidiary of Sumathi Holdings. Equipped with advanced photovoltaic panels and a SCADA-based monitoring system, the Wewila Solar Plant generates efficient and reliable power even under variable weather conditions. It is expected to produce around 7 million kilowatt-hours of clean electricity annually, offsetting approximately 3,000 tonnes of CO₂ emissions, and supplying the equivalent annual electricity demand of around 2,500–3,000 Sri Lankan homes.

Commenting on the commissioning of the project, Chairman Jagath Sumathipala stated, “This project sets a clear path for sustainable regional development by reducing carbon emissions while protecting natural resources across the island. It is an investment not just in energy, but in the long-term wellbeing of the generations who will shape Sri Lanka’s future.”

The successful commissioning of the Wewila Solar Plant expands Sumathi Energy’s renewable energy portfolio and builds upon the momentum of the Group’s earlier hydro initiative. This milestone reinforces Sumathi Holdings’ role as a forward-looking contributor to Sri Lanka’s energy transformation and its journey towards a more sustainable future.
