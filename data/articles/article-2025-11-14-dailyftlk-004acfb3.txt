Enfection, a marketing-technology company focused on AI-led communication and experience solutions, was selected to showcase its latest AI Knowledge Agents at the National AI Exhibition and Conference 2025, held on 29 and 30 September at the Monarch Imperial in Colombo.

At the event, Enfection presented its AI Knowledge Agent developed for ACCA, designed to assist teachers and Advanced Level students with guided explanations, instant answers, and continuous learning support. The company also introduced Sri Lanka’s first AI avatar-led interactive annual report for People’s Leasing & Finance PLC, enabling stakeholders to explore corporate information through an interactive visual agent rather than static documents.

Organised by SLT-Mobitel in collaboration with the Digital Economy Ministry, the National AI Exhibition and Conference brought together local and international experts, innovators, and policymakers to discuss Sri Lanka’s AI progress and its ambition to establish itself as a regional leader in the field.

Enfection’s Head of AI Development, Thareef Bin Ubaid, said the company’s participation reflects its commitment to developing accessible, real-world AI applications. “Our goal is to create solutions that make knowledge sharing simple and meaningful. These innovations have the potential to transform services in healthcare, tourism, financial literacy, and marketing,” he said.

With a growing focus on responsible and scalable AI, Enfection aims to contribute to the country’s digital advancement while expanding Sri Lanka’s presence in the regional marketing technology market.
