Futurity Ltd., Sri Lanka’s first AI-native research studio, has announced its strategic partnership with the Institution of Engineers, Sri Lanka (IESL) as the official AI Enablement Partner for Techno 2025.

The collaboration was formalised at a signing ceremony attended by senior representatives from both organisations, including IESL President Elect and Techno 2025 Chairman Eng. Kosala Kamburadeniya, and IESL CEO Eng. Neil Abeysekera, alongside Futurity’s leadership team.

As part of the agreement, Futurity will introduce a revolutionary AI-powered conversational assistant that is set to transform the way visitors experience Techno 2025. This cutting-edge application will allow visitors to navigate the exhibition seamlessly, access detailed information on exhibitors, and receive real-time guidance on event schedules and highlights. The assistant represents a fundamental shift in how exhibitions are organised and experienced, moving beyond static directories and brochures to deliver dynamic, intelligent, and interactive visitor support.

This collaboration underscores IESL’s commitment to positioning Techno 2025 as more than just an exhibition. But as a living demonstration of future-ready technology in action. By embedding AI into the visitor journey, the exhibition aims to set a new standard in engagement, efficiency, and knowledge-sharing within Sri Lanka’s innovation ecosystem.

Alongside Futurity, Invos Global Ltd., will serve as the official Technology Partner, bringing deep expertise in enterprise-scale technology deployment, while Cyaniq Ltd., joins as the Communications Partner, leveraging its strengths in strategy and storytelling to enhance outreach. Together, the three organisations are aligning their complementary strengths to deliver a holistic and future-facing experience for Techno 2025.

“Techno 2025 is not only about showcasing engineering excellence but also about creating smarter, more connected experiences,” said Futurity Co-Founder and Director Supun Kaluarachchi. “Through effortless intelligence, our AI assistant will ensure every visitor can unlock the full potential of the exhibition.”

“This partnership reflects IESL’s vision to embrace innovation and highlight the transformative role of AI in shaping Sri Lanka’s future,” said IESL President Elect and Techno 2025 Chairman Eng. Kosala Kamburadeniya. “By working with Futurity and its partners, we are setting a benchmark for what modern exhibitions can achieve.”

Futurity Head of Business Dimitri Abeyratne emphasised that the initiative will act as a proof point for how Sri Lanka can deploy advanced AI technologies in practical, public-facing contexts: “This is about taking AI out of research labs and boardrooms and placing it directly in the hands of people, giving them a smarter, more informed, and more enjoyable event experience.”

Techno 2025 is set to welcome thousands of professionals, innovators, students, and industry leaders. With the integration of AI, the event is poised to deliver not only an exhibition of products and ideas but also an immersive journey powered by intelligence and connectivity.
