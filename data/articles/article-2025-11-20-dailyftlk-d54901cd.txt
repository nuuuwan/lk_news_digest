Viet Nam explores cooperation opportunities with Northern Province

A delegation from the Embassy of Viet Nam in Sri Lanka led by Ambassador Trinh Thi Tam  concluded a three-day official visit to Sri Lanka’s Northern Province from 17–19 November 2025. The visit aimed to explore opportunities for collaboration between Viet Nam and the Northern Province, with a focus on strengthening economic, trade, investment and tourism linkages.

On 17 November, Ambassador Trinh Thi Tam paid a courtesy call on the Northern Province Governor Nagalingam Vethanayahan. She also held discussions with Chief Secretary  Thanuja Murugeson and senior local government representatives in key sectors including Agriculture, Education, Health and Tourism.

Ambassador Tam commended the province for its continued progress in economic recovery, social development, security, and efforts to uplift living standards despite long-standing challenges. She reiterated Viet Nam’s interest in expanding cooperation in agriculture, fisheries, livestock, tourism, trade, and investment. Strengthening provincial-level partnerships, the Ambassador noted, would enable both sides to build on their comparative advantages as bilateral relations continue to grow positively after 55 years of establishment (1970-2025).

Governor Vethanayahan emphasized the strategic importance of the Northern Province as Sri Lanka’s closest gateway to Southeast Asia. Highlighting the region’s fertile land, long coastline, and abundant natural resources, he noted strong potential for agribusiness, aquaculture, livestock development, tourism, logistics and renewable energy.

He further outlined the province’s priorities, including industrial zones, special economic zones, and logistics infrastructure, and welcomed Vietnamese investors to explore opportunities in export-oriented agro-processing, infrastructure development, education, healthcare, and renewable energy.

Local authorities also briefed the delegation on challenges faced by the province, such as gaps in infrastructure, lack of processing facilities, and industrial capacity, especially value-added industries. They expressed hope for enhanced cooperation, technical support and skill training from Viet Nam in these areas.

On 18 November, the Embassy of Viet Nam, in collaboration with the Jaffna Chamber of Commerce, hosted a roundtable discussion with representatives of the Northern Province business community.

The session introduced Viet Nam’s business and investment environment and explored opportunities for cooperation in high-tech agriculture, food processing, construction, logistics, energy, and tourism.

Ambassador Tam highlighted Viet Nam’s stable investment climate, skilled workforce, modern infrastructure, and extensive network of free trade agreements, which together offer a conducive environment for Sri Lankan investors. She recalled the commitment made during President Dissanayake’s State Visit to Viet Nam in May 2025, where both countries agreed to raise bilateral trade to $ 1 billion—an ambition that requires strengthened engagement between government agencies and the private sector.

The Ambassador affirmed the Embassy’s readiness to support enterprises from both countries by facilitating connections and promoting practical cooperation.

Business leaders from the Northern Province expressed hope that Vietnamese companies would play a proactive role in exploring and investing in the region, particularly as Sri Lanka continues to navigate economic challenges. They proposed practical cooperation in high-tech agriculture, aquaculture, agro-aquatic processing, and requested assistance in technology transfer, capacity building, and skills training.
