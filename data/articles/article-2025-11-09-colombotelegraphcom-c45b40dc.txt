A Call For Political Wisdom: Tamils Must Not Repeat The Same Mistake Again

As the Northern Province anticipates its next Provincial Council election, the date remains unannounced, and the NPP government appears to be delaying the process under various pretexts. Yet, discussions about possible candidates are already gaining traction, and one name in particular has captured public attention – former High Court Judge Manickavasagam Ilancheliyan.

A respected jurist with decades of service in Sri Lanka’s judiciary, Ilancheliyan’s record has attracted both praise and criticism. Rumours circulating among Tamil nationalist and anti-government groups suggest that he may be encouraged to contest for the position of Chief Minister.

Following nearly ten months of silence, Ilancheliyan re-emerged publicly in London, attending an event organised by his village community to honour his service. In his remarks, he reflected on his disappointment at being denied promotion to the appellate courts and expressed sadness at how his career ended. Importantly, he did not declare support for any political party, nor did he announce an intention to contest.

However, his emotional tone and comments about responsibility to the Tamil community have reignited speculation. In this uncertain political atmosphere, he must act immediately to make a clear public statement to either confirm or firmly deny his political involvement. Remaining silent while rumours intensify risks damaging both his reputation and the unity of the Tamil community.

While every citizen has the democratic right to enter politics, the Tamil community both in Sri Lanka and across the diaspora must reflect carefully before endorsing anyone. Leadership in the North cannot become another ceremonial experiment.

We have already witnessed this scenario once. When another retired Chief Justice, C. V. Wigneswaran, was elevated to Chief Minister without prior administrative experience, the result was five wasted years.

During his term, the Northern Provincial Council achieved virtually no development. Infrastructure projects stalled, employment creation failed, and investor confidence collapsed. The period became defined by ego, division, and political showmanship, weakening the very party that sponsored him, the Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi. Eventually, Wigneswaran split the party and formed his own movement, further fracturing Tamil representation at a national level.

Now we risk repeating history. The re-emergence of retired personalities, lacking governance or development experience, being paraded as Tamil saviours, is alarming.

If the Tamil people once again allow symbolic figures to be manipulated by opportunistic groups, the North and East will endure another cycle of stagnation while the rest of the country progresses.

A Chief Minister should be a builder, negotiator, and problem solver, not a ceremonial icon. Leadership requires practical understanding of agriculture, fisheries, education, infrastructure, tourism, and private sector growth, not courtroom speeches or emotional appeals.

The real challenge facing Tamils today is economic revival, not political drama. While remembering the past remains essential, our focus must now shift to creating jobs, encouraging small enterprises, and building confidence among the youth to stay and thrive in their homeland.

Choosing leaders purely for their symbolic value is a path to disappointment. Political maturity means selecting candidates from the grassroots, those with experience, credibility, and a clear plan for Northern development.

If Judge Ilancheliyan truly wishes to serve the Tamil community, he should do so by using his legal experience and moral standing to unite fragmented Tamil groups, not by becoming another divisive figurehead. His potential contribution lies in empowering unity and guiding development policy, not in partisan politics.

Diaspora organisations also bear responsibility. Endorsing personalities without examining their practical capability risks deepening public disillusionment. The diaspora must focus its influence on economic partnerships, education initiatives, and youth employment, not celebrity politics.

The Tamil people have endured enough frustration under ego-driven politics. The next generation deserves leaders who act quietly, effectively, and with humility.

The Northern Province cannot afford another five years of paralysis. The NPP government’s ongoing delay in announcing the Provincial Council elections should not distract us from demanding accountable leadership when the time comes.

At this critical moment, Judge Ilancheliyan must step forward and end the speculation, either by publicly ruling out political involvement or by declaring his vision transparently. The people have a right to know.

Let this election, whenever it is held, be a turning point for Tamil political maturity. Let us reject emotional theatrics and demand competence, honesty, and vision.

The Tamil people need builders, not figureheads. It is time for development, unity, and truth, not another illusion of leadership.
