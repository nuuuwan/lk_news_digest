When Reptiles Ruled the Rupee

Senior banker Dr. Nimal Rathnayake tells The Sunday Island how Sri Lanka’s currency evolved from ancient Kahapanas to colourful banknotes that celebrated the island’s hidden biodiversity.

“Money tells stories — not just of kings and commerce, but of art, identity, and nature,” said Dr. Nimal Rathnayake, senior banker, researcher, and member of the IUCN Species Survival Commission, speaking to  The Sunday Island.

His lifelong curiosity about the intersection of economy and ecology has led him to a fascinating observation: reptiles, those silent survivors of Sri Lanka’s wilderness, have left their mark even on the nation’s banknotes.

For Dr. Rathnayake, currency is far more than a medium of exchange. “It’s a mirror of our civilisation,” he explained. “Every coin and note reflects the political, cultural, and ecological pulse of the era it was born in.”

Long before bank vaults and interest rates, trade on the island flowed through barter and simple tokens. Farmers swapped rice for honey, craftsmen traded tools for spices. Around the 3rd century B.C., Sri Lanka’s earliest coins — the Kahapanas — entered circulation.

“These punch-marked silver coins,” Dr. Rathnayake told The Sunday Island, “were etched with symbols like the swastika, fish, and sun. Each mark carried meaning — prosperity, power, or protection. They were as much talismans as they were tender.”

Over centuries, these symbols evolved with dynasties. The Maneless Lion coins, Lakshmi plaques, and Kahavanu reflected Anuradhapura’s and Polonnaruwa’s artistry. Traders arriving from Rome, Arabia, and China introduced their own currencies — proof that Sri Lanka’s harbours pulsed with international exchange long before the modern era.

“Coins tell the story of connectivity,” Dr. Rathnayake noted. “You can trace our links with the world through what we minted and what we accepted.”

When European powers arrived — Portuguese, Dutch, and then the British — Sri Lanka’s coins began to carry foreign emblems alongside local motifs. From the Rix Dollar and Stuiver to the Pagodi and Tanga, money became a reflection of shifting empires.

The establishment of the Central Bank of Ceylon in 1950 marked a turning point. The new nation, freshly independent, sought monetary sovereignty.

“The Central Bank didn’t just regulate finance,” Dr. Rathnayake explained. “It became a curator of identity — deciding which faces, flora, and fauna would tell the story of a nation on its notes.”

The Bank’s mission, enshrined under the Monetary Law Act No. 58 of 1949, was to ensure financial stability while supporting economic growth. Yet behind those technical mandates, another mission quietly unfolded: to design notes that celebrated Sri Lanka’s rich cultural and natural heritage.

Though coins dominated for centuries, paper currency made its Sri Lankan debut under Dutch rule. On May 10, 1785, the first batch of banknotes — printed in denominations from 1 to 1000 Pathaga — entered circulation. Their purpose was practical: to fund security and administration. But they also represented the first step toward modern banking.

“Each note was hand-signed by three officials,” said Dr. Rathnayake. “They weren’t just receipts — they were promises, backed by trust.”

Later, during the British era, new denominations emerged alongside coins. Notes printed in Colombo and London bore the royal insignia, colonial crests, and maritime emblems — blending imperial authority with local pride. By the mid-20th century, these designs began to evolve into distinctly Sri Lankan creations.

In 1979, a new chapter unfolded. The Central Bank released the Flora and Fauna Series, designed by the late Laki Senanayake, the iconic artist, sculptor, and environmental visionary.

“This was a masterpiece of national storytelling,” said Dr. Rathnayake, speaking to The Sunday Island with admiration. “Laki took our biodiversity — trees, birds, fish, reptiles — and placed them in everyone’s hands.”

Each note burst with colour and ecological symbolism. The design captured more than beauty; it celebrated endemism. “It was as if the island’s forests, rivers, and dry plains had come alive in ink,” he added.

Senanayake, who spent years observing nature from his home at Diyabubula, understood that art and conservation could coexist. His designs echoed his belief that human progress and natural heritage must grow together — a message as urgent now as it was then.

Among the six notes in the 1979 series, two bore creatures that rarely make headlines: the Haly’s Tree Skink (Dasia haliana) and the Damon Ground Gecko (Cyrtodactylus yakhuna) — both endemic, both distinctly Sri Lankan.

On the two-rupee note, Dasia haliana appears alongside the curry leaf tree (Murraya koenigii), black ruby barb, and lacewing butterfly — a snapshot of the dry zone’s living tapestry. The skink, slender and slow-moving, prefers large trees and feeds on insects. Its dark crossbands stand out vividly on the young lizard’s body, a striking pattern that once caught Senanayake’s artistic eye.

“The presence of this humble tree skink on our currency,” Dr. Rathnayake observed, “is deeply symbolic. It reminds us that even the smallest lives in our forests are part of our national wealth.”

The five-rupee note featured Cyrtodactylus yakhuna, or the Damon Ground Gecko — a nocturnal reptile that inhabits the leaf litter of Polonnaruwa and Anuradhapura. With its cream-brown body and irregular bands, the gecko may not command attention, but in the quiet rhythm of the dry zone night, it reigns.

“These species are not majestic like elephants or flamboyant like peacocks,” he told The Sunday Island. “Yet they embody resilience — surviving in balance with the environment. Laki captured that truth beautifully.”

Sri Lanka today is home to 246 species of reptiles — from the elusive chameleons and skinks to the formidable crocodiles and monitor lizards. Out of these, 165 are endemic, and 122 are threatened, placing the island among the world’s top tropical regions for reptilian diversity.

“The numbers tell a powerful story,” Dr. Rathnayake said. “They speak of both abundance and vulnerability.”

He stressed that conservation is no longer an optional pursuit. “When a child sees a gecko or skink on a banknote and asks, ‘What is this creature?’, that question itself is a spark — it’s how awareness begins.”

Dr. Rathnayake believes that the role of currency extends beyond economics. “Notes are cultural ambassadors,” he asserted. “They travel, they’re exchanged, they circulate — carrying with them the story of who we are.”

Indeed, Sri Lanka’s evolution through twelve series of banknotes — from King George VI’s portrait to the 2010 ‘Development, Prosperity and Sri Lankan Dancers’ series — maps a nation’s journey from colonial dependency to confident sovereignty.

“In 1951, our notes carried foreign monarchs,” he recalled. “Today, they carry our dancers, heritage sites, and wildlife. That’s progress in print.”

Even as the world moves toward cashless transactions, he argues that printed money still holds a profound emotional and educational value. “A digital wallet cannot capture the brushstrokes of a Laki Senanayake,” he said with a smile. “You can’t smell the ink, or feel the texture of heritage.”

As Dr. Rathnayake leafed through his collection of old coins and faded notes, there was reverence in his gaze. Each artifact, he said, carries not just economic history but ecological wisdom.

“Our ancestors didn’t separate nature from value,” he reflected. “They understood that the land, its rivers, and its creatures were sources of wealth. In many ways, our coins and notes are quiet reminders of that balance.”

He paused before adding, “When we destroy ecosystems, we’re erasing not just species — we’re erasing stories. The Haly’s Tree Skink and Damon Ground Gecko may be small, but they’ve earned a place in our national narrative. That’s something to celebrate.”

In an era when plastic money and virtual payments dominate, few pause to look at the quiet artistry in their wallet. But perhaps they should. The next time you hand over a note, think of the brush that drew it, the forest it represents, and the reptile it immortalised.

“Money,” said Dr. Rathnayake, speaking to The Sunday Island, “may change form, but its power to tell stories endures. And on our island, those stories often begin with nature.”

He smiled, tucking a weathered five-rupee note back into his folder. “It’s not just currency,” he said softly. “It’s memory — of who we are, and the living world that shaped us.”
