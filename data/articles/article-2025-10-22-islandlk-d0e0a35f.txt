Dialog e-Load Super Blast hands over second Toyota Raize SUV to winner in Kandy

Dialog Axiata PLC, Sri Lanka’s #1 connectivity provider, has further strengthened its drive toward digital empowerment by awarding the second Toyota Raize SUV grand prize and marking a major milestone of over one million winners through its ongoing “Dialog e-Load Super Blast” rewards campaign. The initiative continues to encourage Sri Lankans to embrace digital reloads as the smarter, faster, and more rewarding way to stay connected.

The second grand prize draw took place on 18th October during the vibrant “Siyatha Tharu Piree Ra with Dialog e-Load Super Blast” live TV show, where S. M. R. P. B. Sakalasooriya from Kandy drove away in a brand-new Toyota Raize SUV. With one more draw scheduled for December, the campaign continues to transform the digital reload experience islandwide — combining convenience, excitement, and life-changing rewards.
