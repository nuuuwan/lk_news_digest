Cyclone Senyar brings unstable weather; Colombo-Kandy road closed

Sri Lanka is bracing for unsettled conditions as Cyclone Senyar, formed from a well-marked low over the southwest Bay of Bengal, moves north-northwest and is expected to intensify into a depression within 24 hours, according to the Indian Meteorological Department.

Showers and strong winds are likely in the Eastern, Northern and North Central Provinces, with rough seas along the eastern and southeastern coasts.

Heavy rain linked to the system has forced authorities to keep the Colombo-Kandy main road closed at Pahala Kadugannawa due to the continued risk of rock and earth collapses. The National Building Research Organisation (NBRO) said the section cannot be reopened yet following fresh instability after earlier rockfalls in the Ganethenna area. Motorists have been advised to use alternate routes until conditions improve. All upcountry train services between Colombo Fort and Badulla will terminate at Nanuoya until further notice due to prevailing adverse weather conditions, Sri Lanka Railways announced.

Eastern Province Governor announced that all Muslim schools within the Eastern Province will be closed from today till further notice due to adverse weather conditions.
