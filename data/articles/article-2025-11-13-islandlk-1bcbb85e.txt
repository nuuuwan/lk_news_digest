Beauty … with Ice Cubes

This week I’ve decided to give The Island readers a few simple homemade beauty tips with ice cubes and water.

Of course, you can add ingredients like cucumber, green tea, or rose water, to frozen ice cubes, for added benefits, like reduced puffiness, pore tightening, and a brighter complexion.

Remember to always cleanse your face before applying ice and wrap the ice in a thin cloth (for sensitive skin), and avoid using ice daily, to prevent skin irritation.

Dip your face into the bowl, with eyes closed, for 10-15 seconds, repeating this 04-05 times.

Rub an ice cube gently over your face to reduce puffiness and tighten pores.

Ice cubes can help calm irritated skin, reducing redness and inflammation.

Ice cube massage can help improve circulation and tone your skin.

Cold temperatures cause pores to shrink, giving your skin a smoother appearance.

For pore tightening and a smoother base, before makeup, mix 04 tablespoons of cucumber juice and 02 tablespoons of rose water. Pour into an ice tray, and freeze. Then gently rub a cube over your clean face for 30 seconds.

To calm, moisturise, and brighten skin, mix concentrated rosewater with regular water, freeze, and then gently massage a cube over your face for a clean-up effect.

To control oil and reduce acne, freeze a mixture of tomato juice and a few drops of tea tree oil. Rub on oily areas of clean skin.
