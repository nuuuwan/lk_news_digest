India As A Rising Global Power In The G20

The 2025 G20 Summit in Johannesburg, South Africa, marked a profound and historic inflection point in global economic diplomacy. By hosting the world’s most influential economic forum for the first time, Africa cemented a symbolic shift toward greater diversity, equity, and representation in global governance.

South Africa’s presidency, under the banner of “Solidarity, Equality, and Sustainability,” successfully advanced the developmental priorities set by the preceding three Global South presidencies—Indonesia (2022), India (2023), and Brazil (2024). This sustained momentum fundamentally reshaped the G20 agenda in favour of inclusivity, climate justice, reform of multilateral development banks (MDBs), and technology-driven development.

The Summit unfolded against a backdrop of significant geopolitical tensions and a fractured multilateral environment. A key measure of the G20’s resilience was the successful adoption of a comprehensive Leaders’ Declaration, despite the absence of the United States from the negotiations and Argentina’s withdrawal from the drafting process.

President Cyril Ramaphosa that the Declaration—a 122-point document—reflected a renewed commitment to the UN Charter, multilateral cooperation, and strengthening the voice of developing nations through institutional reforms. The Declaration notably embraced the African philosophy of Ubuntu, emphasizing the interconnectedness of the global community, and strongly condemned attacks against civilians and infrastructure in conflict areas, aligning itself with international law.

India maintained a particularly active and influential role, further solidifying its reputation as a “growth anchor” and a consensus-building power within the G20. India’s growing stature is underpinned by strong economic fundamentals. The country has averaged growth of over 7 per cent over the past four financial years, positioning it as the fastest-growing major economy in the G20, with projected growth exceeding 6.5 per cent over the next five years. This performance is critical to the global economy, particularly at a time when many advanced economies are experiencing prolonged stagnation.

Deep Integration: The G20 bloc accounts for more than 60 per cent of India’s total exports and over half of its imports, underscoring the depth of India’s commercial integration with major global economies.

Sectoral Leadership: India’s emergence as a global hub for digital innovation, renewable energy, pharmaceuticals, and services has strengthened its position as both a vast consumer market and a critical global supplier across multiple value chains.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi framed India’s diplomatic outreach through the lens of Integral Humanism—an Indian civilisational concept that promotes a holistic view of human, social, and natural well-being. This philosophical clarity underpinned India’s core message:

The Johannesburg Summit delivered several landmark outcomes, many of which were driven or strongly supported by India, with a focus on future-ready governance and resilience.

The Summit held deep significance for South–South solidarity, a commitment India had championed by successfully advocating for the African Union’s permanent membership in the G20 during its 2023 presidency. South Africa’s hosting of the Summit marked a natural progression of this effort.

G20–Africa Skills Multiplier Initiative: A major Indian proposal adopted by the G20, this programme operates on a “train-the-trainers” model. Its objective is to create a pool of one million certified trainers across Africa over the next decade, who will, in turn, skill millions of young people and significantly boost local capacity.

India’s proactive agenda emphasised resilience, technology, and equitable access. Under the G20 framework, India proposed a set of forward-looking initiatives aimed at addressing critical global challenges.

The G20 Critical Minerals Circularity Initiative focuses on promoting recycling, urban mining, and second-life battery technologies to secure supply chains vital for the global energy transition, while reducing dependence on primary mining and minimising environmental damage.

Through the G20 Open Satellite Data Partnership, India advocates a unified and interoperable platform that enables developing countries to access geospatial satellite data from G20 space agencies, supporting agricultural planning, fisheries management, climate monitoring, and early disaster-warning systems for floods and droughts.

The G20 Global Healthcare Response Team seeks to establish a rapid-deployment network of medical experts from member countries to provide timely assistance during pandemics and natural disasters, thereby strengthening global health security and preparedness.

In addition, the G20 Initiative on Countering the Drug–Terror Nexus promotes a coordinated, multi-instrument strategy to combat global drug trafficking—particularly highly lethal synthetic narcotics such as fentanyl—which finance organised crime and terrorist networks. This initiative aims to enhance global security and public health by disrupting illicit financial linkages.

The Leaders’ Declaration endorsed ongoing work on global tax transparency, including frameworks for the taxation of immovable property, and called for enhanced climate financing and accelerated energy transitions.

India also strongly advocated for a Global Compact on Artificial Intelligence, rooted in principles of transparency, human oversight, safety-by-design, and strict prohibitions against misuse, including deepfakes and cybercrime. India invited G20 partners to participate in the AI Impact Summit in New Delhi in 2026 to build consensus on human-centric AI governance.

Furthermore, Prime Minister Modi emphasised the urgent need to reform global institutions such as the UN Security Council, arguing that the exclusion of major emerging economies—including India, Brazil, and South Africa—reflects an outdated post-war global order.

The Johannesburg Summit was an intensive period for Indian diplomacy, resulting in key bilateral engagements that helped shape strategic directions:

India–Canada: Leaders agreed to commence negotiations on a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA), with the goal of doubling bilateral trade to USD 50 billion by 2030. They also welcomed the Australia–Canada–India Technology and Innovation (ACITI) Partnership.

India–Japan: Discussions reinforced the Special Strategic and Global Partnership, with a review of progress in defence, technology, and semiconductor supply chains.

India–Italy: Both countries adopted a Joint Initiative to Counter the Financing of Terrorism and enhanced cooperation across space, defence, and industrial sectors.

India–South Africa: Prime Minister Modi and President Ramaphosa reviewed cooperation on critical minerals, digital public infrastructure, and youth exchange programmes, reaffirming their shared commitment to amplifying the voice of the Global South. South Africa also reiterated its support for India’s upcoming BRICS Chairship in 2026.

The Johannesburg Summit thus stands as a watershed moment, successfully blending historical symbolism with tangible, forward-looking commitments and underscoring the growing influence of emerging economies in shaping a more equitable and resilient global future.
