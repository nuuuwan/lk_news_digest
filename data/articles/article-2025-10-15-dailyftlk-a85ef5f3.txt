Sri Lanka to sign anti–money laundering MoUs with Vatican, Mauritius

Sri Lanka’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) of the Central Bank is set to sign Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) with the Financial Intelligence Units of Vatican City State and Mauritius to strengthen cooperation in combating money laundering, terrorism financing, and proliferation financing.

Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa said yesterday that both proposals had received Cabinet approval.

He said the agreement with the Vatican’s FIU, also known as the Financial Information Authority of the Holy See, will facilitate the exchange of information between the two institutions to support global efforts against financial crimes.

A similar MoU between Sri Lanka’s FIU and the Mauritius FIU was also approved to enhance cross-border collaboration and intelligence sharing in the fight against illicit financial activities.
