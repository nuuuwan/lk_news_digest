CoPF reviews revenue performance of key Finance Ministry institutions

Public Debt Management Office briefs on Govt.’s Medium-Term Debt Management Strategy for 2026–2030

Outlines annual borrowing plan for 2026, clarifies projected financing requirements and debt sustainability measures

CoPF informs BOI and related agencies to intensify efforts to ensure growth in FDI in coming years

Approves eight reports submitted under Public Finance Management Act, No. 44 of 2024

The Committee on Public Finance (CoPF) has reviewed the financial performance of major revenue-generating agencies under the Finance Ministry for the period up to September 2025. The review was carried out last week when the Committee, chaired by MP Dr. Harsha de Silva, convened in Parliament.

Senior officials from the Inland Revenue Department (IRD), Sri Lanka Excise Department, and Sri Lanka Customs presented updates on the progress of their respective institutions, outlining revenue performance and operational outcomes for the year thus far.

Officials from the Public Debt Management Office (PDMO) also briefed the Committee on the Government’s Medium-Term Debt Management Strategy for 2026–2030.

They also outlined the annual borrowing plan for 2026, providing clarifications on projected financing requirements and debt sustainability measures.

The Board of Investment (BOI) presented a progress update on foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows. The BOI reported that Sri Lanka had attracted $ 827 million in FDI from January to September 2025.

The Committee noted that while this reflects positive momentum, the BOI and related agencies must intensify efforts to ensure a consistent and sustainable growth trajectory in foreign investment over the coming years.

In addition, the Committee granted approval for eight reports submitted under the Public Finance Management Act, No. 44 of 2024, all of which require CoPF endorsement as part of the statutory financial oversight process.
