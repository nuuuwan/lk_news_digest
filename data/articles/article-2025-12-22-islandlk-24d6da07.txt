Inner Vision at the Gatz

The group Inner Vision is gradually making its presence felt in the local showbiz scene.

They made their debut, early this year, performing at The Little Hut, in Mount Lavinia, and now find themselves ready to do the needful at the famous Gatz.

The band will be featured on Boxing Day, 26th December, from 8.30 pm onwards.

Located at Cinnamon Life, City of Dreams, Gaz has now become the ‘in place’ for high class entertainment, and Inner Vision is looking forward to creating an exciting scene for those who make it to Gaz this Friday.

And, on New Year’s Eve, Inner Vision will usher in 2026 at the Cheers Pub, in Colombo.

The band also has regular dates at The Irish Pub, in Colombo.

In fact, they will be doing the Christmas Eve scene, that’s tomorrow night, at the Irish Pub.

Bassist Benjy Ranabahu is extremely happy with the progress Inner Vision is making and is confident 2026 will be an exciting year for the band.
