Binance contributes Rs. 61.6 m for flood relief in Sri Lanka

Funds directed through Sri Lanka Red Cross Society to support communities impacted by Cyclone Ditwah

In response to the devastating impact of Cyclone Ditwah, which has triggered severe rains and flooding across Sri Lanka, Binance Charity, the philanthropic arm of the global blockchain leader Binance, has pledged Rs. 61.6 million ($ 200,000) to support urgent humanitarian and early-recovery efforts. The donation will be directed through the Sri Lanka Red Cross Society (SLRCS) to bolster immediate relief for communities affected by the widespread destruction.

Cyclone Ditwah has disrupted the lives of over one million people nationwide, submerging homes, damaging critical infrastructure, and cutting off access to essential services. According to the Disaster Management Centre, nearly 200,000 individuals are currently taking refuge in over 1000 temporary shelters after being displaced by the heavy rainfall and flooding. Authorities have noted that power, water and communications will be gradually restored over the next few days, after transmission lines and transformers were swept away by the cyclone and resulting floods.

Binance Charity’s contribution will be allocated toward life-saving relief essentials, including food supplies, clean drinking water, hygiene and dignity kits, medical supplies, emergency medical assistance, and temporary shelter materials as well as providing cash grants for the most vulnerable communities. This support aims to ease the immediate burden on displaced families and help accelerate recovery efforts in the hardest-hit districts.

Binance Head of APAC S.B. Seker said: “We are deeply saddened by the scale of devastation caused by Cyclone Ditwah. Binance is committed to mobilising timely and effective support for communities impacted by natural disasters. Through our collaboration with the Sri Lanka Red Cross Society, we aim to ensure that essential relief reaches families who are facing unimaginable loss. Our thoughts are with the people of Sri Lanka, and we remain dedicated to supporting their path to recovery.”

Sri Lanka Red Cross Society Secretary General Dr. Mahesh Gunasekara said: “Cyclone Ditwah has created an unprecedented humanitarian challenge, leaving thousands in urgent need of assistance. The Sri Lanka Red Cross Society is fully mobilised on the ground, providing life-saving support and helping affected communities regain stability. We sincerely appreciate the generous contribution from Binance Charity, which strengthens our capacity to respond swiftly and effectively. Strategic partnerships of this nature are critical to delivering timely relief and supporting the recovery of the most vulnerable to build back better.”

The cyclone has severely affected the country, resulting in extensive flooding, infrastructure collapse, and widespread displacement. With a significant portion of the population still in shelters and facing heightened health and safety risks, urgent relief remains critical to restoring dignity, stability, and access to essential services.
