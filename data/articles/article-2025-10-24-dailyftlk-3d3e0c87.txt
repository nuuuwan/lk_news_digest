From eco-conscious travel planning to empowering local communities, our mission has always been to preserve the natural beauty of Sri Lanka while delivering authentic experiences for our guests. We are honoured that our work has been acknowledged at a national level.”

Dutch Trails has consistently championed introducing novel concepts in harvesting the ample natural resources of Sri Lanka sustainably, aligning with national environmental goals and global sustainability standards. The company continues to invest in sustaining local resources and empowering communities to ensure long-term ecological balance and socio-economic impact.

Organised annually by the Central Environmental Authority, the Presidential Environment Awards honour institutions, individuals, and enterprises that demonstrate outstanding achievements in environmental management and sustainable practices.
