Suwanda Industries recertified as ZeroCarbon® Manufacturer for 2025

Suwanda Industries, known globally under the brand name Cycle Pure Incense, is proud to announce its recertification as a ZeroCarbon® Manufacturer for 2025. This marks another significant milestone in the company’s ongoing journey of environmental responsibility and purpose-driven business.

As Sri Lanka’s only Carbon Neutral Manufacturer of Incense Sticks, this achievement reaffirms the company’s unwavering dedication to reducing its environmental impact while promoting sustainable growth and community empowerment.

“Being recertified as a ZeroCarbon® Manufacturer is more than a badge of honour, it is an endorsement of the responsibility we carry,” said Anuradha Ekanayake, CEO of Cycle Pure Incense (Suwanda Industries). “Our purpose has always been to craft products that bring peace, fragrance, and spiritual connection into people’s homes — but we believe this must never come at the cost of the Earth. This recognition renews our commitment to honour the planet, just as we honour the traditions and lives our products touch each day.”

The certification was awarded by The Sustainable Future Group (SFG) following a rigorous audit process that reviewed the company’s carbon footprint across its operations. According to Sajeewa Ranasinghe, Manager – Sustainability Assurance and Verification Services at SFG, “Cycle Pure Incense has continued to demonstrate strong environmental leadership. Their efforts in adopting renewable energy, improving energy efficiency, and maintaining sustainable practices throughout their manufacturing processes have been commendable. These initiatives contribute not only to environmental goals but also to long-term operational resilience.”

Though officially established in 2011, the story of Cycle Pure Incense Sri Lanka began much earlier not as a business, but as a promise. In 2009, amidst the fragile aftermath of war, a small initiative was born to restore dignity and livelihood to families torn by conflict, especially women-led households in the Northern and Eastern regions of Sri Lanka. What started as a community support project grew, through compassion and vision, into a pioneering venture.

Today, it stands as a joint effort between Eswaran Brothers (Pvt) Ltd , a trailblazer in Sri Lanka’s value-added tea industry and N. Ranga Rao & Sons (Pvt) Ltd, India’s largest and most respected incense manufacturer. From its roots in resilience and recovery, Cycle Pure Incense has blossomed into a brand that carries not only fragrance, but hope, purpose, and a legacy of healing.

Today, that original spirit of service continues to breathe life into every corner of the business. At its heart are the women of Sri Lanka’s local communities resilient, resourceful, and empowered. Through the company’s pioneering “Women Packing Units Concept,” many have stepped into leadership roles, transforming their lives and uplifting those around them. It’s more than a model for economic inclusion; it’s a celebration of community strength and the power of shared opportunity.

From these roots of purpose, Cycle Pure Incense has grown into a name trusted in over 75 countries offering innovations like the heritage-inspired Parampara Incense Sticks, delicately crafted with natural herbs and essences, the only incense stick of its kind in the market, as well as Cycle Cup Sambrani and Cycle Long Burn Sticks.
