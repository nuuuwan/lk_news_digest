The Chartered Institute of Personnel Management Sri Lanka (CIPM), in collaboration with Mercer, announced the winners of the Great HR Awards 2025, recognising organisations that have demonstrated exemplary performance in human resource management across the country. Brandix Apparel (Pvt) Ltd was named the Overall Winner, achieving the highest accolade among a wide range of public and private sector participants.

Brandix Apparel (Pvt) Ltd secured the top honour through its comprehensive and future-focused approach to people management, which included strong leadership development initiatives, robust talent analytics, a structured and measurable approach to employee wellbeing, and scalable learning and development opportunities.

Submissions for the Great HR Awards were evaluated across 16 key HR paradigms, including talent development, leadership capability, employee wellbeing, organisational culture, HR digitisation, rewards management and performance management. The judging outcomes highlighted an important national trend: Human Resource Management is increasingly evolving into a strategic, data-driven function that directly influences organisational performance, resilience, and competitiveness.

By recognising organisations that demonstrate excellence, the Awards encourage wider adoption of progressive HR practices and set a clear benchmark for others to emulate. This recognition also fosters a culture of continuous improvement, prompting organisations to prioritise innovation in areas such as employee experience, workforce capability building, growth behaviour and leadership development, resulting in stronger talent pipelines, healthier workplaces, and more agile business models that can adapt to emerging challenges.

In addition to the Overall Winner accolade, the event also presented Category Awards, Sector Awards, Excellence Awards, Merit Awards & Commendation Certificates acknowledging organisations that exhibited outstanding performance across specialised HR domains.

The event, attended by over 600 industry leaders, CEOs, and HR professionals, highlighted the growing importance of strategic people management in driving long-term organisational success aligned with corporate strategy and sustainable growth.
