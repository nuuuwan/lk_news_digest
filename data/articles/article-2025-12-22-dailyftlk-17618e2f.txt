CJ leads delegation of 10 Apex Court judges for knowledge exchange with Indian judiciary

A knowledge exchange and interaction program for 10 Apex Court judges of Sri Lanka was organised by the Supreme Court of India, New Delhi, and National Judicial Academy (NJA), Bhopal, from 8-12 December.

The delegation was led by Chief Justice Preethi Padman Surasena.

At a de-briefing session held at the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka on 18 December 2025, the Justices shared their experiences and takeaways from the program with High Commissioner of India Santosh Jha, and expressed gratitude to the Government of India and the Indian Judiciary for the initiative.

The program was divided into two parts: a 3-day module at NJA Bhopal, followed by 2 days in New Delhi. The Bhopal leg saw exchanges and interactions of the Sri Lankan Justices with Indian counterparts, resource persons and technical experts on various themes such as Constitutional interpretation, climate justice and environment protection, transforming justice delivery with advent of new technologies, emerging trends in human rights and international legal obligations, media and public perception of justice, among others.

The New Delhi leg included interactions with Chief Justice of India, Justice Surya Kant, and Justices of the Supreme Court, as well as Attorney General for India R. Venkataramani and Solicitor General of India Tushar Mehta; participation in court proceedings in Chief Justice of India’s Court; briefing on e-initiatives of the Supreme Court of India and e-filing, and visit to the Delhi High Court.

The exchange program was organised as part of ongoing cooperation between India and Sri Lanka in the field of capacity development, deepened by the announcement by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, made during his State visit to Sri Lanka in April 2025, of 700 additional customised slots annually for Sri Lankan professionals.
