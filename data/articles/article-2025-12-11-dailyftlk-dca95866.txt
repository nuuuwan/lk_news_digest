India has sent over 300 tons in humanitarian relief assistance to Sri Lanka to support ongoing emergency operations after Cyclone Ditwah left thousands displaced and caused extensive damage across multiple districts.

The consignment arrived in Colombo on Sunday and was formally handed over by the Indian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka Santosh Jha. It was received on behalf of the Government by Minister Wasantha Samarasinghe and the Director General of the Disaster Management Centre (DMC).

The relief cargo was transported by Indian naval vessels, including three Landing Craft Utility ships and INS Gharial. The shipment includes essential food items such as sugar, pulses and milk powder, as well as bed sheets, towels, sarees, dhotis and tarpaulins for emergency use in affected communities. A second consignment was expected to arrive in Trincomalee yesterday as part of India’s continued assistance effort.

Sri Lankan officials welcomed the timely support, noting that the items will be dispatched immediately to cyclone-hit regions where relief teams are working to provide shelter, food and basic supplies to displaced families. India’s assistance comes as part of a broader international response to the disaster, with more aid expected in the coming days.
