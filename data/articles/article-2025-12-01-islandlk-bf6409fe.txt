Ceylon Chamber affirms support for national recovery efforts following Cyclone Ditwah

The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce is deeply saddened by the devastation caused by Cyclone Ditwah, and our thoughts are with all individuals, families, and communities affected by this tragedy. We mourn the loss of lives and acknowledge the immense hardship endured by thousands who have been displaced and whose livelihoods have been severely disrupted. In the wake of this national crisis, the Chamber, together with the generous support of our members, has been working closely with Government agencies to coordinate urgent relief efforts. The unwavering resilience of Sri Lankans is evident in moments such as these. It is a pivotal time for the nation to come together, pooling our collective strength to restore lives, livelihoods, and stability.

The Sri Lanka Economic and Investment Summit was originally designed as a platform to advance economic growth and investment. In light of recent events, its purpose has taken on even greater meaning. The summit now serves as an essential forum to collectively reflect on the road to recovery, discuss strategies to strengthen national resilience, and reaffirm our shared commitment to rebuilding a stronger and more stable Sri Lanka. Our priority is to support the country’s recovery and the restoration of communities and livelihoods.
