AKD questions morality of ex-Presidents’ privileges after bankrupting SL

Points to fact of millions going to bed without a single meal; people suffering without means to buy medicine; children not having schools and youth without jobs

President Anura Kumara Disanayake yesterday in Parliament questioned the morality of his predecessors opposing the Government’s move to cut some of their privileges.

“We have removed the undue privileges of former presidents. Some may feel pain about this. But we worked according to the mandate of the people,” the President said during the presentation of the 2026 Budget.

“Some people argue about the privileges given to former presidents and prime ministers in other countries. However, those countries did not go bankrupt like us. Unfortunately, our country was made bankrupt,” recalled Disanayake.

“In a country where children do not have schools; in a country where millions of people go to bed without even a single meal; in a country where people suffer without the means to buy medicine to save their lives; in a country where innocent youth suffer without jobs, is it at least moral for former presidents to continue to enjoy privileges? Is it possible to remain like that?” queried President Disanayake in Parliament.
