MSF supports Sri Lanka flood relief with delivery of winterised tents to Disaster Management Centre

Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) continues its humanitarian response to the devastating floods and landslides caused by Cyclone Ditwah, which has affected over 1.8 million people across Sri Lanka. MSF is working closely with local partners to address urgent needs in hygiene, shelter, and healthcare.

MSF has delivered 1,000 winterised family tents and 1,500 heavy-duty plastic sheets to the Disaster Management Centre on 14 December. These tents are specially designed to provide safe, warm, and durable shelter for displaced families, particularly in colder regions. The tents will help protect vulnerable populations from exposure to harsh weather conditions and reduce the risk of illness.

MSF in Sri Lanka Emergency Coordinator David Croft said, “Providing these winterised tents is a critical step in ensuring displaced families have access to safe and adequate shelter during this challenging time. Our teams remain committed to working alongside local partners to adapt our response as the situation evolves and to support the recovery efforts in Sri Lanka.”

Additionally, MSF has distributed 500 relief kits and 500 dry ration kits to support families displaced by the floods. MSF is preparing to distribute 250 maternity kits and 400 dignity kits to ensure safe maternal care and maintain dignity in emergency shelters.

MSF’s approach emphasises collaboration with locally led organisations and the Disaster Management Centre to ensure aid reaches those most in need efficiently and effectively.
