Digital Wings takes off in Sri Lanka: Empowering students through technology

The initiative reflects a deep commitment to bridging the digital divide in Sri Lanka, particularly in rural regions where connectivity and equipment are scarce. By providing essential tech tools, the company hopes to ignite curiosity, improve digital literacy, and build confidence among students and educators alike.

The inaugural phase of this heartwarming project unfolded at Parakum Maha Vidyalaya, Vavuniya, where laptop.lk donated laptops, desktops, and printers worth over Rs. 1 million. For the students and teachers, this isn’t just technology—it’s a passport to possibility.

Spearheaded by laptop.lk Chairman Famy Ismail, Digital Wings represents more than a corporate contribution; it’s a call to action. “Every child deserves the tools to dream bigger, learn faster, and explore further,” said Ismail. “Digital Wings is our way of ensuring that no student is left behind in a world driven by technology.”

As Sri Lanka continues to embrace digital transformation, initiatives like Digital Wings bring hope to rural communities where resources are limited but talent is boundless. The program underscores laptop.lk’s belief that progress begins with access to knowledge and that every student, regardless of geography or background, deserves the chance to excel.

Digital Wings is a timely reminder that progress begins with inclusion—and that when young minds are given the tools to soar, the entire nation rises with them.
