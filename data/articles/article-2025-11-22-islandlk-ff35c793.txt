How Sri Lanka abandoned its own healthcare revolution

In the 1970s, Professor Senaka Bibile pioneered a revolutionary pharmaceutical policy that promised to convert healthcare for the developing world. His National Medicinal Drugs Policy created a rationalized system using 630 generic medications, eliminating brand names, banning manufacturer promotions, and consolidating imports through the State Pharmaceutical Corporation. The policy aimed to guarantee quality drugs at affordable prices while ensuring doctors prescribed only necessary medications.

The World Health Assembly in Geneva recognized Prof. Bibile’s achievements in May 1982, with delegates from 47 countries participating in negotiations on pharmaceutical rationalization. A WHO official acknowledged that the guiding philosophy of WHO’s Action Programme on Essential Drugs was “based on that recommended by the late Professor Bibile of Sri Lanka.” By 2013, as many as 37 developing nations had successfully implemented similar policies. Yet Sri Lanka—the birthplace of this innovation—has systematically failed to adopt its own professor’s vision.

When President J.R. Jayewardene introduced open economic policies in 1978, he abandoned Bibile’s programme entirely. What followed was decades of broken promises, mysterious file disappearances, and legislation that betrayed the original principles. The story of this abandonment reveals the extraordinary power of multinational pharmaceutical corporations to subvert national policy and condemn millions to financial hardship.

Professor Bibile, working with Communist Party Leader Dr. S.A. Wickremasinghe, developed the “essential medicines” concept that should have protected patients. Instead, successive governments carried only fragments of his vision. Today, the SPC procures medicines for government services at excellent prices, enabling free healthcare provision. However, the pharmaceutical mafia heartlessly promotes expensive branded products to specialists who prescribe by brand name, distressing patients economically.

In 2005, the UPFA government promised to implement the National Medical Drugs Policy (NMDP). The Cabinet approved it in principle in 2007, establishing a National Standing Committee that comprised the People’s Movement for Rights of Patients. Health Minister Maithripala Sirisena declared his Ministry a “bottomless pit of corruption” in 2011 and pledged to slash drug prices by two-thirds before leaving office. Instead, drafts shuttled between government offices for years, files strangely disappeared, and the process delayed indefinitely.

Sirisena himself exposed during his presidential campaign that someone offered him a bribe adequate to “nurture seven generations” while serving as Health Minister. He revealed that the original National Drugs Policy was “stolen while it was in the womb” and had to be organized a second time. An allegation of high level corruption was made regarding the mysterious disappearance of a file in this regard. Minister Rajitha later stated the amount offered to him was Rs. 300 million. But there was silence on the offender’s identity.

By 2013, Sirisena presented a draft bill that totally deviated from Bibile’s proposals. The People’s Movement for the Rights of Patients condemned it as a document prepared by the pharmaceutical gang itself. Professor Carlo Fonseka, former Chairman of National Authority on Tobacco and Alcohol and President of the Sri Lanka Medical Council, ridiculed it as totally unsuitable, a mockery lacking the essential medicines model, quality control theory, or regulatory mechanism.

Minister Rajitha’s 2016 announcement to reduce costs of 47 medicines proved merely a political stunt, benefiting only prosperous consumers purchasing expensive pharmaceuticals. Drug cartels later increased rates of lower-priced medicines to align with elevated regulatory ceilings, affecting most citizens, a typical case of daylight robbery.

The pharmaceutical industry’s distinctive marketing feature is that the ultimate customer isn’t the patient who pays, but the doctor who prescribes. Immoral practitioners receive lucrative incentives: five-star family holidays, sponsored medical education for children, monthly payments running into hundreds of thousands, all in exchange for prescription practices dictated by manufacturers. Poor patients pay inflated prices for substandard, superfluous products while exposing themselves to harmful biochemical side-effects.

Wall Street statistics divulge that eleven US pharmaceutical giants made $65 billion in 2010, more than the other 489 Fortune 500 companies combined. Second only to arms trading in profitability, Big Pharma uses its wealth to counterbalance every opposing institution, spreading tentacles through education, manufacturing, research, importing, testing, registration, quality control, distribution, and prescription systems.

Former British Medical Journal editor Richard Smith published an article titled “Is the Pharmaceutical Industry like the Mafia?” documenting the methodical corruption of science by drug companies to exaggerate benefits and downplay harms. The industry influences doctors, academics, journals, patient organizations, regulators, and politicians using mob-like tactics. Forbes Magazine questioned industry trustworthiness in “Is Big Pharma Addicted to Fraud?” noting that legal prescription drug abuse makes the American medical system a foremost cause of death.

When President Sirisena established the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) in July 2015, appointing Professors Lal Jayakody and Krisantha Weerasuriya as Chairman and CEO respectively, the new authority immediately incited systematic corruption. Officials discovered that drug shortages in state hospitals were “well calculated,” remedied through a corrupt practice called “No Objection Letters.”

The SPC would bypass registered suppliers during shortages, importing unknown-quality medicines at inflated prices through the previous Cosmetic Devices and Drugs Authority (NMRA). In one case, the SPC requested importing the anxiolytic sedative Lorazepam through an unregistered supplier for Rs. 36 million. When NMRA insisted on proper tenders from the four registered suppliers, the lowest bid was only Rs. 250,000—just 0.7% of the original quotation.

Similarly, the SPC sought importing Gentamycin antibiotic eye drops from Merit Organic India, bypassing twelve registered suppliers. The product wasn’t even in the company’s manufacturing profile. When the NMRA called a media conference to explain its work and expose corruption, Health Ministry Secretary Anura Jayawickrama summoned Chairman Professor Jayakody and ordered its cancellation, citing administrative regulations. This blatant suppression occurred during World Media Freedom Week, contradicting government commitments to transparency. Within months, both Jayakody and Weerasuriya faced removal charges alleging inefficiency—a clear message to anyone threatening pharmaceutical interests.

Professor Bibile died on September 29, 1977, in Guyana under circumstances that remain deeply suspicious. During a WHO consultancy, a “Professor of Medicine” from a West Indies University hosted Bibile and his wife for dinner with drinks. Bibile, who suffered from tachycardia, developed a severe cardiac attack afterward. His usual remedy failed, governmental delays prevented hospital admission, and he died at the entrance.

Regional medical specialists concluded that just two drops of digitalis in alcohol would fatally intensify his heart condition, a claim vehemently rejected by Bibile’s close associates but consistent with the Mafia-style “we are watching you” threats he had received. Whether murdered or not, Sri Lankan health ministers and authorities have repeatedly “murdered” his legacy.

In Minister Nalinda Jayatissa lies our only hope of shattering decades of systemic corruption. The moment for bold, uncompromising action is now, while reform remains politically viable. Countries like Australia force pharmaceutical companies to price branded drugs marginally above generics through health insurance negotiation. South Africa has succeeded with effective pricing formulas. Swift measures could radically cut healthcare dollar outflows while shielding our people from excessive medication.

Two fundamental necessities remain unmet: authorizing that doctors prescribe only by generic names (the 2015 legislation was undermined by allowing brand names alongside), and compiling a list of essential drugs imported exclusively by the SPC. Until valid answers emerge, the media must educate the public about Big Pharma’s clandestine operations, the harmful properties of unnecessary drugs, billions lost in foreign exchange, and unprecedented gains achievable through Bibile’s reforms.

Civil society must demand better medicine prices. Had Bibile’s policies been fully implemented, these crises would never have occurred. The battle continues between uninformed consumers and marketing deception, between vested interests and public welfare. The question remains: do Sri Lanka’s current politicians possess the necessary transparency and determination to finally honor the vision of their greatest medical innovator? Or will the pharmaceutical faction continue to profit while the poor suffer?

Four decades of systematic sabotage have denied Sri Lankans access to affordable,
