Bank of Ceylon (BOC) continued to demonstrate its strength and stability in the 3Q 2025, reaffirming its role as a cornerstone of Sri Lanka’s financial landscape. With a Profit Before Tax (PBT) of Rs. 87.7 billion recorded for the first nine months of the year, the Bank showcased consistent growth driven by disciplined financial management, strategic business expansion, and a strong commitment to supporting national economic progress. This performance reinforces BOC’s reputation as a trusted institution, one that not only adapts to changing economic conditions, but also leads with confidence, resilience, and purpose.

Bank of Ceylon Chairman, Mr. Kavinda de Zoysa, stated, “As we close the third quarter of 2025, Bank of Ceylon continues to reaffirm its purpose of building a financially inclusive and economically empowered Sri Lanka. Our strong financial performance of this quarter reflects the success of our strategy to balance profitability with purpose, ensuring that growth benefits every segment of our society.

By providing affordable financial services and supporting young innovators and small businesses (SMEs), we are not only strengthening individual livelihoods but also fueling the nation’s long-term economic resilience. Bank of Ceylon stands firm in its mission to drive inclusive prosperity, sustain strong financial growth, and inspire a future where every Sri Lankan can thrive”.

During the first nine months of 2025, BOC continued to deliver strong and sustainable financial performance, reflecting both strategic focus and disciplined execution. The Bank recorded a Profit before Tax (PBT) of Rs. 87.7 billion, a remarkable 133% increase compared to Rs. 37.6 billion in the corresponding period of 2024. This robust performance was driven by a 62% growth in Net Interest Income (NII) to Rs. 153.2 billion, highlighting the Bank’s ability to strengthen core banking income while maintaining operational efficiency and financial resilience.

BOC effectively navigated the evolving interest rate environment, recording a 15% increase in interest income to Rs. 368.1 billion, alongside a 5% reduction in interest expenses to Rs. 214.9 billion. The resulting improvement in net interest margin demonstrates strong balance sheet management and strategic repricing strategies.

Non-fund-based income also played a vital role in boosting overall earnings. Net fee and commission income increased by 11% to Rs. 16.8 billion, driven by growing customer engagement in digital channels, card usage, retail transactions, and remittance flows.

Total operating income rose 61% to Rs. 181.1 billion, while operating expenses increased by only 6% to Rs. 51.8 billion, reflecting effective cost management. This resulted in a notable improvement in operational efficiency, with the Bank achieving a cost-to-income ratio of 32%.

Operating profit before taxes on financial services rose to Rs. 111.1 billion and after accounting for Rs. 23.4 billion in taxes on financial services and Rs. 31.9 billion in income tax expense, the Bank reported a solid Profit After Tax (PAT) of Rs. 55.7 billion. During the period, BOC also contributed Rs. 55.3 billion in direct and indirect taxes, reaffirming its pivotal role in supporting national fiscal stability. (BOC)
