Govt. clarifies stance on vehicles assigned for former Presidents’ security

Public Security Minister Ananda Wijepala told Parliament yesterday that the repeal of the Former Presidents’ Entitlements Act does not affect the Government’s duty to ensure the personal security of former heads of state.

He explained that while some former Presidents have voluntarily returned vehicles previously allocated for their security, such matters are separate from the repealed law.

Wijepala added that providing protection for former presidents remains a State responsibility. He noted that if any requests are made for security vehicles or other assistance, the Government is prepared to supply the required resources.
