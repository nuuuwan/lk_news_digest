SriLankan Airport and Ground Services roll out self-check-in service for customer airlines

The sole ground services provider at Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA), is rolling out its self-check-in service for passengers of customer airlines ahead of the winter travel high season, which is expected to bring over 300,000 tourists to the island in December alone. The initiative, made possible by the airline’s IT team, follows the installation of 20 new self-check-in kiosks at the departure terminal last month, bringing the total to 28 and boosting airport efficiency and the overall passenger experience in line with Sri Lanka’s tourism development efforts.

Since its launch in 2023, the self-check-in kiosk facility has seen a strong uptake, with an increasing number of travellers opting for self-service over traditional counters. Currently, 15% of SriLankan’s passengers flying out of BIA use the kiosks, helping ease congestion at the departure terminal. The facility enables passengers to bypass queues and complete their check-in independently by selecting seats, printing boarding passes and generating bag tags in just a few simple steps.
