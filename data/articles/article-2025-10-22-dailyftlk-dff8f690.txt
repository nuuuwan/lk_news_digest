Panasian Power connects 5MW Ampara solar plant to national grid

Panasian Power PLC yesterday said it has successfully connected a 5MW ground-mounted solar project at Deegawapiya, Ampara, to the national grid through the Ampara Grid Substation on 17 October 2025.

The company said the project marks the fifth 5MW ground-mounted solar power plant connected to the national grid out of seven projects that entered into power purchase agreements (PPAs) in the third quarter of 2024.

The project, operated through a subsidiary of Panasian Power, has commenced revenue generation.

“This testing and commissioning represents a significant milestone in our renewable energy development strategy, adding another 5MWac/6.76MWp to the national grid and supporting Sri Lanka’s commitment to expanding its renewable energy capacity,” the company said.

Panasian Power said the project integrates advanced technology, utilising Longi Bi-facial N-type Solar PV 615 W modules with Fixed Tilt technology. The DC capacity has been enhanced to effectively harness solar resources and ensure an optimum AC/DC design ratio.
