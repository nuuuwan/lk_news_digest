President alleges State funds fuelled both Muslim, Sinhala extremism

President Anura Kumara Dissanayake addressing the gathering at the Remembrance of those who laid down their lives including the founder of the party, Rohana Wijeweera.

President Anura Kumara Dissanayake yesterday alleged that intelligence reports have confirmed funds from State accounts were used to support both Muslim and Sinhala extremist groups.

He asserted that successive Governments have “used racism for their own survival,” alleging that extremist elements on both sides were sustained with taxpayer money.

“During a recent meeting with the intelligence officials confirmed that the same State resources were diverted to fuel divisions in our society, promoting extremism for political gain,” he said.

His remarks highlight concerns over the alleged misuse of public funds to manipulate social and religious tensions, raising questions about accountability in previous administrations.
