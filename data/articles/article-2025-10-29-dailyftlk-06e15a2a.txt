The appointment was handed over by Austrian Ambassador to India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, the Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka Katharina Wieser at a reception at the Galle Face Hotel in Colombo.

A cocktail reception recently held at the Executive Lounge of the Galle Face Hotel in Colombo also marked a significant milestone in Austria-Sri Lanka diplomatic relations. The event, hosted by Malik Fernando, honoured Katharina Wieser.

The evening witnessed the formal presentation of credentials to Fernando by Ambassador Wieser, solidifying his position and underscoring the strengthening diplomatic partnership between the two nations. This ceremonial gesture represents a pivotal moment in fostering enhanced bilateral cooperation across trade, culture, and investment.

Fernando brings exceptional credentials to his diplomatic role.

His academic achievements include a Post Graduate Diploma in Management from Brunel University, London, and a Bachelor of Arts in Accounting from the University of Essex, UK.

Born in Colombo, Fernando has established himself as a prominent figure in Sri Lanka’s dynamic business landscape. His appointment follows years of dedicated service as Head of Chancery under former Honorary Consul Thomas Frank Daetwyler, whose transformative mentorship has been instrumental in shaping Fernando’s diplomatic expertise.

“It is an immense honour to formally assume this role and strengthen the enduring friendship between Austria and Sri Lanka,” stated Fernando. “Our nations share common values of innovation, cultural excellence, and economic dynamism. I am committed to facilitating greater collaboration, creating mutually beneficial opportunities for both Austrian and Sri Lankan enterprises.”

The reception brought together distinguished guests from diplomatic, business, and cultural communities, reflecting broad interest in Austria-Sri Lanka relations. Discussions centred on emerging opportunities in renewable energy, digital transformation, tourism infrastructure, and educational partnerships.

The timing of the event, coinciding with recently celebrated Austrian National Day, added particular significance, highlighting Austria’s commitment to strengthening its South Asian presence through enhanced diplomatic engagement.

The successful reception underscores the robust foundation upon which Austria-Sri Lanka relations continue to flourish, promising enhanced cooperation and mutual prosperity in the years ahead.
