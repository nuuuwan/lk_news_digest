A certification scheme to protect the integrity of Ceylon Tea

Ceylon Tea, the world’s most celebrated brew, reached a new milestone this week with the successful completion of the “Ceylon Tea Value Creation Through the Development of Geographical Indication (GI) and International Quality Certifications” project — an initiative backed by the French Development Agency (AFD), with technical support from the French Agricultural Research Centre for International Development (CIRAD) and the Institute of Policy Studies of Sri Lanka (IPS).

The initiative, which began in 2021, is expected to position Ceylon Tea alongside globally protected products such as Champagne and Roquefort — elevating its prestige, safeguarding authenticity, and ensuring fair value for Sri Lankan producers.

Speaking at the topic Perspectives on Geographical Indications in Sri Lanka, yesterday at Hilton Colombo Residence, French Ambassador to Sri Lanka and the Maldives, Rémi Lambert, hailed the occasion as “a significant step in Sri Lanka’s path toward protecting more of its unique products.”

“This project has helped to collectively define what makes Ceylon Tea unique — a product renowned around the world for 150 years and one of Sri Lanka’s main exports. With its upcoming registration in the European Union, Sri Lanka will gain a powerful legal instrument to protect the name of Ceylon Tea, strengthening consumer confidence, and supporting the people whose expertise and dedication uphold its reputation, Lambert said.

He emphasized that France, a pioneer in geographical indications since the early twentieth century with more than 700 registered GIs, remains deeply committed to supporting the global expansion of this framework.

“Once registered, Ceylon Tea will join a global family of products whose quality and origin are celebrated, like French Champagne, the ambassador noted, adding that AFD and CIRAD have been instrumental in extending GI expertise across the globe — from the Philippines to Ethiopia, and Senegal to Cambodia.

The Geographical Indication certification, once fully operational, will not only safeguard the Ceylon Tea brand from imitation but also strengthen its market positioning in Europe and beyond. Industry experts see this as a crucial mechanism for enhancing the export value of Sri Lanka’s premier agricultural commodity, which remains a vital source of foreign exchange.

The French-backed project involved extensive collaboration between Sri Lanka’s tea stakeholders — including the Sri Lanka Tea Board, the Tea Smallholders Association, the Planters’ Association of Ceylon, and numerous exporters and research institutions.

Ambassador Lambert praised this collective effort, acknowledging the resilience and vision of the country’s tea community.

“This project has been a long but rewarding journey, made possible thanks to the dedication of everyone in the tea sector. The work will now continue with the Sri Lanka Tea Board and the GI Management Committee, who will bring the Geographical Indication to life, he said.

The ambassador further commended the Sri Lankan government’s growing commitment to intellectual property protection in the agricultural sector. “With the success of Ceylon Cinnamon and the new national GI framework in Sri Lanka, iconic food and craft products will soon follow, he added, citing forthcoming initiatives to secure GI protection for king coconut and Sri Lankan cashew.

The GI registration comes at a crucial time when the global tea market is increasingly competitive. Industry analysts note that geographic indication labeling not only ensures traceability and product integrity but also commands premium prices in niche markets.

Plantations Minister Samantha Vidyarathna, who attended the event, noted that this partnership with France underscores Sri Lanka’s commitment to maintaining global standards while uplifting local producers. “We are working to ensure that smallholders benefit from GI protection, which can translate into tangible income growth for rural communities, he said.

As Sri Lanka looks ahead, the GI certification of Ceylon Tea signals not just a triumph of branding and diplomacy, but a renewed era of quality assurance, economic sustainability and international recognition for a product that has defined the island’s identity for over a century.
