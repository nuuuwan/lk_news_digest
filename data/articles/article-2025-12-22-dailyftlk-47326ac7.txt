RDA revises ticketing system at Kerawalapitiya Interchange from today

The Road Development Authority (RDA) has announced changes to the ticket issuing system at the Kerawalapitiya Interchange on the Outer Circular Highway, with the revised arrangements set to take effect from 12 noon today (22).

The changes follow an Extraordinary Gazette notification suspending the collection of tolls at the Kerawalapitiya Interchange on the Colombo-Katunayake Expressway, prompting operational adjustments to ease traffic movement and avoid duplication in ticketing.

Under the new system, vehicles entering the Colombo-Katunayake Expressway via the Seeduwa and Peliyagoda interchanges will no longer be issued entry tickets at Kerawalapitiya Interchange 1. Instead, motorists will receive their entry tickets directly at the Seeduwa or Peliyagoda interchanges when accessing the expressway.

The RDA said vehicles travelling from the Outer Circular Highway and entering the Colombo-Katunayake Expressway will also no longer be required to obtain an exit receipt and a new entry ticket at the Kerawalapitiya Interchange. Exit receipts will continue to be issued only to vehicles leaving the expressway at Kerawalapitiya Interchange 2, in line with the existing procedure.

Accordingly, all motorists entering the Colombo-Katunayake Expressway must obtain entry tickets at either the Seeduwa or Peliyagoda interchanges. Vehicles arriving from the Outer Circular Highway will be permitted to enter the Colombo-Katunayake Expressway without obtaining an entry ticket, while those exiting at the Kerawalapitiya Interchange will still be required to pay the applicable exit toll.

The Authority also clarified that electronic toll payment facilities will be available only for travel on the Colombo-Katunayake Expressway. Vehicles using electronic toll payments to enter the Outer Circular Highway must continue to use the designated cash toll lanes.
