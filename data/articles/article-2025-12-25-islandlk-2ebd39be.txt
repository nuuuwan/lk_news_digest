Harsha de Silva urges President to appoint an Auditor General

Dr. Harsha de Silva, Chair of the Committee on Public Finance (CoPF), has urged President Anura Kumara Dissanayake to immediately fill the Auditor General vacancy, which has been open since December 7, according to Lanka Business Online (LBO).

In a letter dated December 22, Dr. de Silva has emphasized that the absence of an Auditor General disrupts constitutional mandates under Articles 148 and 154, which grant Parliament control over public finance.

He noted that the vacancy severely hinders the work of the Public Accounts Committee (COPA) and the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE), especially as the nation navigates a critical flood disaster.

As the head of the committee overseeing the National Audit Office, Dr. de Silva stressed that a swift appointment is essential to maintain transparency and financial oversight.
