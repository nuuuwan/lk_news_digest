NCE affirms continuity of export sector following recent floods

The National Chamber of Exporters of Sri Lanka (NCE) has expressed its deep concern over the severe floods that have affected many parts of the country in recent days.

In a statement the Chamber said: “Our thoughts and heartfelt solidarity are with all Sri Lankans who have been impacted especially the families who have been displaced, as well as businesses and livelihoods that have suffered extensive losses.”

The Chamber is currently gathering information on the extent to which export-oriented companies, their factories, production plants, and supply chains have been affected. Early indications reveal that many exporters have been heavily impacted, with several production facilities going under water, causing significant damage to machinery, equipment, stocks, and critical infrastructure. This has brought operations in many companies to a standstill, and exporters are deeply concerned about their ability to meet international delivery timelines.

Sri Lanka’s export sector is the backbone of the national economy, contributing significantly to foreign exchange earnings, employment generation, and overall economic stability. The country is already navigating a fragile economic recovery, and any prolonged disruption to export activities will have far-reaching consequences. Exporters play a vital role in sustaining supply chains, maintaining global buyer confidence, and supporting thousands of direct and indirect livelihoods across rural and urban regions.

Production cycles have been interrupted, delaying fulfilment of overseas orders.

Equipment and factories have suffered severe damage, requiring costly repairs and replacements.

Supply chains, including transport routes, storage facilities, and labour access, have been disrupted.

SMEs and aspiring exporters are at high risk, as many do not have the financial buffers to recover quickly.

Maintaining buyer confidence is crucial. Any significant delay in shipments can result in cancelled contracts, loss of market access, and long-term setbacks for companies who have invested years in building their reputations. For Sri Lanka, ensuring uninterrupted export performance is essential not only for business continuity, but also for national economic resilience. Therefore, it is vital that affected exporters receive swift support so they can resume operations as quickly as possible.

The NCE is also conducting a special assessment of its aspiring exporters startups and MSMEs who have joined the Chamber to scale up their export potential. These emerging businesses are particularly vulnerable to disruptions of this magnitude, and many are still unable to assess the full extent of damage to their facilities.

NCE urges all member companies to share details of damages, operational challenges, and expected delays so that the NCE may engage with the appropriate Government agencies to coordinate immediate assistance and recovery interventions.

NCE President Indhra Kaushal Rajapaksa said: “At this critical moment, Sri Lanka’s export sector requires immediate and targeted support. The floods have disrupted production, damaged essential facilities, and created significant uncertainty for exporters who are already under immense pressure to meet international commitments. The export sector is not just another part of the economy — it is the engine that drives our foreign exchange earnings, sustains national revenue, and supports hundreds of thousands of livelihoods. Any extended interruption will have a serious impact on the country’s overall economic stability.

“Sri Lankan exporters have always demonstrated resilience in the face of adversity. We are confident that, despite the challenges, our exporters will recover stronger and continue to serve their global buyers while supporting the national economy.

“The NCE stands ready to work closely with the Government and all relevant authorities to ensure the rapid rehabilitation of affected companies. Prioritising the recovery of exporters is essential to safeguarding Sri Lanka’s reputation as a reliable and competitive trading partner.”

NCE CEO/Secretary General Shiham Marikar said: “The NCE is actively collecting on-the-ground information from affected exporters, including MSMEs and aspiring exporters who rely heavily on the Chamber’s support to expand their international presence. Early feedback indicates widespread disruptions, including flood-damaged production floors, equipment failures, stalled supply chains, and workforce challenges.

“We urge the Government to urgently collaborate with the NCE to develop and implement short-term and long-term relief measures including financial assistance, expedited repair support, and facilitation for exporters who are struggling to meet shipment deadlines. A swift and coordinated recovery plan is essential for ensuring that Sri Lanka does not lose its hard-earned market access and global competitiveness.”
