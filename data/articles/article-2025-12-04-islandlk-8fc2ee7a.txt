Fems’ three-year winning streak at the SLIM Brand Excellence Awards showcases its mission to empower women nationwide

Fems, one of Sri Lanka’s leading feminine care brands, continued its strong performance at the SLIM Brand Excellence Awards 2025, securing three major wins this year. The brand has maintained a consistent presence at the awards for three consecutive years, from 2023 to 2025, earning a series of Gold, Silver and Bronze recognitions across key categories.

In 2025, Fems received Gold for CSR Brand of the Year and for Innovative Brand of the Year, and secured Bronze for Local Brand of the Year. The accomplishment is a momentous landmark for the brand as Fems becomes the first feminine hygiene brand in Sri Lanka to win Local Brand of the Year, consolidating leadership for its deep local relevance and consumer trust.

Fems’ recognition as CSR Brand of the Year, Gold highlights purposeful, impact-driven initiatives truly delivering results. Throughout the years, Fems has demonstrated an unwavering dedication to tackling period poverty and breaking cultural taboos around menstrual health.

Addressing the critical issue of low sanitary napkin usage in Sri Lanka, Fems introduce the affordable ‘Fems AYA’ range, launching H.E.R. Foundation with three pillars: Help, Empower, and Rise, to fight period poverty, normalize menstruation, and celebrate women overcoming challenges. The brand has educated over 400,000 women and girls engaging schools, factories, plantations, universities, and prisons, extending monthly donation programmes for female inmates. These initiatives demonstrate Fems’ holistic commitment to menstrual health, education, and empowerment islandwide.

Winning Innovative Brand of the Year, Gold captures Fems’ bold approach to redefining the feminine hygiene category through a progressive approach. Fio WhatsApp chatbot, Sri Lanka’s first-ever WhatsApp chatbot dedicated to female health, recorded over 40,000 messages within its first three months of launch. Fems also pioneered digital innovations such as Fio App, Sri Lanka’s first Trilingual Period Tracker App, which received more than 50,000 downloads in the first three months of its launch.

Initiatives such as sanitary napkin dispenser units in public spaces, and educational outreach campaigns challenging long-standing norms, were among the many innovations introduced to keep the Sri Lankan female consumer at heart.

In addition, the brand continues to expand its product portfolio to meet diverse consumer needs. The new 3X Protection proposition — offering Leak Proof, Skin Safe, and Body Fit features, further strengthening consumer confidence in the brand. Meanwhile, the Ultra‑Thin range caters to personalized needs with a longer and thinner format of pads, ensuring comfort without compromise. Also, the cycle pack that caters to menstrual flow throughout the period days.

Securing Local Brand of the Year, Bronze is particularly significant, as Fems is the first feminine hygiene brand in Sri Lanka to achieve such a recognition.
