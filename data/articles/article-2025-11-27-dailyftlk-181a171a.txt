Govt. to compensate weaving mill employees affected by closures

The Cabinet of Ministers on Monday approved compensation for employees who lost their jobs due to the closure of weaving mills in Thulhiriya and Pugoda.

The decision covers 15 employees of Karbul Lanka Ltd., Thulhiriya, who had previously not received compensation, as well as 169 former employees of the Thulhiriya and Pugoda weaving mills. These individuals had recently submitted appeals seeking due compensation.

Measures have been taken to ensure that all affected employees receive compensation along with other statutory allowances, rectifying the prejudices faced due to the closure of Karbul Lanka Ltd.

This latest approval follows an earlier Cabinet decision on 26 May, under which 1,656 employees of the Thulhiriya and Pugoda weaving mills, which were part of the National Weaving Corporation and lost employment back in 1978, were granted compensation.

The new round of approvals ensures that employees who missed the initial compensation application window will also be reimbursed.
