The US has begun recalling a group of career diplomats serving as Ambassadors and senior embassy officials, including US Ambassador to Sri Lanka Julie Chung, as part of a broader reorganisation of its overseas diplomatic representation.

Officials familiar with the process said Chiefs of Mission in at least 29 countries were notified last week that their assignments would end in January. Many of those affected were appointed during the previous administration and continued in their roles after the change of Government in Washington. Formal notices of recall were issued from the US capital during the week.

Ambassadors serve at the discretion of the President and typically hold office for fixed terms. Those recalled are expected to retain their Foreign Service status and return to Washington for reassignment rather than leave the service.

The US State Department has not disclosed the exact number or identities of the diplomats involved, describing the move as part of routine administrative changes reflecting the President’s authority over diplomatic appointments.

Africa accounts for the largest share of recalls, with missions in 13 countries affected. Changes are also taking place across the Asia-Pacific region, Europe, the Middle East, South Asia and the Western Hemisphere.

Sri Lanka is among the South Asian countries included in the exercise.
