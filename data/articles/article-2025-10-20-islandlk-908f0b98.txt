DSI Samson Group’s D Tech and Odoo ERP unite to offer end-to-end business apps

D Tech (Pvt) Ltd, the digital arm of the DSI Samson Group, recently announced a strategic partnership with Odoo, the internationally acclaimed open-source enterprise resource planning (ERP) platform. Effective immediately, this alliance enables D Tech to provide Sri Lankan businesses with tailored, competitively priced ERP solutions, combining Odoo’s modular global technology with D Tech’s local software-development expertise.

Founded more than a decade ago, D Tech has evolved from serving the internal IT needs of the DSI Samson Group to delivering customised software for a wide range of industries. Through Odoo partner status, D Tech gains access to Odoo’s enterprise technical resources and expert support, allowing the company to design scalable, practical, and cost-efficient business management systems for organisations of all sizes.

Commenting on the recent partnership, Managing Director, D Tech Pvt LTD – Nelani Rajapaksa noted: “The partnership with Odoo marks a significant step in our strategic vision to position D Tech as a leading software and digital solutions provider. It expands our portfolio with international solutions that complement our successful locally developed products, such as Zynolo People.”

This collaboration is expected to accelerate digital adoption among Sri Lankan enterprises, including the country’s rapidly growing small and medium-sized sector, by offering an affordable alternative to high-cost ERP systems. By lowering the financial and technical barriers to enterprise software, D Tech aims to support national objectives for economic modernisation and competitiveness across manufacturing, retail, and services.

Concluding, Nelani Rajapaksa stated: “We have already integrated Odoo into several internal business units and will continue this rollout both internally and with external customers, underscoring our commitment to delivering the best of global and local technology.”
