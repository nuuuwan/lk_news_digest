‘Political short-sightedness fuelling human–elephant tragedy’ : Sajeewa Chamikara

Sri Lanka’s worsening human–elephant conflict (HEC) — one of the deadliest on the planet — has reached what conservationists describe as a “national ecological emergency.”

Each year, more than 400 elephants and around 150 people perish in a spiral of violence that shows no sign of slowing. The numbers reflect not only a conservation crisis but also a profound failure of environmental governance.

For decades, successive governments have promised to “resolve” the conflict, yet the problem has only worsoned . Wildlife experts and environmentalists now say that a lethal combination of political short-sightedness, unregulated land use, and chronic mismanagement has turned Sri Lanka’s majestic elephants into refugees within their own home range.

Environmental activist Sajeewa Chamikara, of the Movement for Land and Agricultural Reform (MONLAR), told The Island that Sri Lanka’s HEC crisis has reached catastrophic proportions due to “decades of policy confusion and political interference in forest management.”

“The government has failed to understand that this is not an elephant problem — it’s a human management problem,” Chamikara said. “Politicians are fragmenting forests for short-term economic gain, allowing encroachments, and destroying elephant corridors. Every time a forest patch is cleared for settlement or cultivation, elephants lose another lifeline.”

The Human–Elephant Conflict Management Plan drafted as far back as 2011, with input from some of Sri Lanka’s leading wildlife biologists, remains largely unimplemented. Instead of a long-term, science-based approach, the state has relied on ad-hoc measures and reactive policies.

“Successive governments have ignored scientific strategies and promoted politically driven solutions such as arbitrary electric fencing. These fences were erected without ecological planning and in many cases cut right across elephant migratory routes,” Chamikara explained.

The document titled Proposals for Resolving the Human–Elephant Conflict — presented recently to the Ministry of Wildlife and Forest Resources Conservation — outlines how poorly planned electric fences have, paradoxically, intensified the conflict. By isolating herds from their foraging grounds and water sources, these fences push elephants into villages and paddy lands in search of food.

Development at the expense of the forest cover and elephant habitats

“In many instances, fences were installed to protect private farmland and illegal settlements within elephant habitats. That’s both illegal and unethical,” Chamikara stressed. “When you block ancient elephant corridors, elephants don’t just vanish. They break through human settlements to survive.”

According to the report, Sri Lanka’s elephant population — estimated at around 6,000 individuals in 2011 — has been forced into increasingly fragmented landscapes. Between 2011 and 2023, thousands of hectares of forest cover have been lost to irrigation projects, agricultural expansion, and political land distributions.

“The Department of Wildlife Conservation (DWC) estimates that around 4,600 elephants now roam disconnected habitats. Many are trapped in small forest patches without adequate water or forage,” Chamikara said. “These elephants are ecological refugees — displaced by human greed.”

The Wildlife and Forest Conservation Ministry’s own figures confirm that more than 4,800 elephant deaths were recorded between 2011 and 2023, alongside the loss of over 1,800 human lives. The majority of these incidents occurred in dry-zone districts such as Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Hambantota, and Ampara — areas that have seen rapid agricultural colonisation and deforestation.

“We’ve reached a breaking point,” Chamikara said bluntly. “Every major development scheme — from irrigation projects to new townships — has been planned without considering elephant ranges. The result is an ecological disaster playing out in slow motion.”

Chamikara accused certain political actors of exploiting land and forest resources for short-term gain while turning a blind eye to the long-term consequences.

He said that state institutions such as the Forest Department, the Land Commissioner’s Department, and the DWC operate without coordination, allowing critical habitats to fall through administrative cracks.

“You have one ministry distributing land for agriculture, another issuing permits for settlements, and yet another trying to protect wildlife — all working in isolation,” he noted. “This bureaucratic chaos benefits only land grabbers and politicians.”

The 2023 National Audit on Wildlife Management found that the DWC had failed to implement nearly 60 per cent of its planned mitigation activities due to “budgetary constraints, unclear responsibilities, and frequent ministerial reshuffles.”

Chamikara also criticised the government’s growing tolerance of forest encroachments under the guise of “rural development.” He said over 4,000 forest reserves have been partially degraded by illegal agriculture and infrastructure expansion.

“Elephants can coexist with humans, but not with corruption and greed,” he remarked. “When land is distributed for political gain, elephants lose their migratory paths. Then we call it a conflict.”

The report calls for a comprehensive and integrated policy framework that recognises elephants as a national asset rather than a nuisance. Among its key recommendations are:

Planning electric fences scientifically, based on movement data, and situating them along the outer boundaries of protected areas — not across migration routes.

Strengthening coordination between the Forest Department, DWC, and Land Commissioner’s Department to end overlapping mandates.

Creating a transparent compensation mechanism for farmers affected by elephant damage, reducing the temptation to retaliate violently.

Launching a national awareness programme linking conservation to rural livelihoods and tourism benefits.

“People who live in elephant ranges are not enemies of conservation — they are its most vital partners,” Chamikara said. “If communities are supported with fair compensation, solar fencing, and sustainable farming, they will protect elephants rather than fear them.”

He urged the government to invest in community-based conservation, noting successful examples from India and Thailand where villagers have been trained and paid as field monitors to manage conflict.

“We can learn from Asia’s other elephant-range countries,” he said. “They have shown that coexistence works when people are empowered and habitats are secured.”

Experts agree that resolving the HEC crisis will require political courage and continuity — not short-term projects launched before elections.

Chamikara warned that Sri Lanka risks losing not only hundreds more elephants each year but also its credibility as a biodiversity hotspot if it continues down the current path.

“Elephants have walked these lands for thousands of years. If we cannot coexist with them today, it’s a reflection of our failure to govern ourselves responsibly,” he said. “Protecting elephants is about protecting our forests, water sources, and the ecological balance that sustains human life itself.”

Sri Lanka’s elephants are a global heritage species, revered in religion, culture, and tourism. Yet they now stand on the frontline of a man-made war — a struggle that symbolises the nation’s wider failure to balance economic ambition with environmental wisdom.

Unless urgent, science-based, and transparent measures are implemented, conservationists warn that Sri Lanka could lose not only a keystone species but a cornerstone of its natural identity.

“The real test of a government’s commitment to the environment,” Chamikara concluded, “is not in how many trees it plants for publicity, but in whether it has the integrity to protect the forests and the elephants that already exist.”
