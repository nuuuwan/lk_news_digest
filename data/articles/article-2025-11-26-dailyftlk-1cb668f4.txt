Govt. expects metro bus service will set new standard for public transport

The proposed metro bus network will introduce a new culture and operating model for Sri Lanka’s public transport sector, Transport and Highways Deputy Minister Prasanna Gunasena told Parliament yesterday, adding that it is intended to become the template for future services.

He said the newly established Metro Bus Company, operating under the SLTB, will function with its own recruitment procedures, pay structure and uniforms, creating a distinct service model within the State transport system.

Transport and Highways Minister Bimal Rathnayake said the pilot metro bus service is scheduled for launch in July next year, with an initial fleet of 70 buses in Colombo. Recruitment for the new entity is expected to be completed between March and April.

The Government yesterday also rolled out a pilot project to enable card-based bus fare payments at the Makumbura transit centre. No additional charges will be imposed on passengers using cards, Rathnayake said at the launch. Bank fees linked to digital payments will be absorbed by bus owners, though he did not detail the specific benefits promised to operators.

The Minister said the payment system will be monitored and adjusted based on early performance. The rollout begins on several routes today, with additional routes to be added from tomorrow.
