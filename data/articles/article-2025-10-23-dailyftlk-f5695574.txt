Rs. 630 m allocated to locally manufacture assistive devices for differently-abled

Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa yesterday said the Cabinet of Ministers has approved a Rs. 630.2 million project to locally manufacture assistive devices for differently-abled persons.

He said the proposal, presented by the Health and Mass Media Minister, will be implemented under the Medium-Term Budget Framework 2025-2027, expanding facilities at the Ragama Blood and Rehabilitation Hospital and the Accident and Orthopaedic Service of the National Hospital of Sri Lanka.

The initiative follows a Rs. 500 million allocation under the 2025 Budget and aims to enhance access to rehabilitation support and reduce dependence on imported assistive devices.
