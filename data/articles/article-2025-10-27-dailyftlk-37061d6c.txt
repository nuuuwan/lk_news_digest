Supports national vision to raise the manufacturing sector’s contribution to 28% and boost national productivity to 52% by 2030

The national program ‘4i Project’ developing 1,000 young entrepreneurs was successfully launched last week by the Industry and Entrepreneurship Development Ministry in partnership with the National Productivity Secretariat and other Government bodies.

Industry and Entrepreneurship Development Minister Sunil Handunneththi said the national program, the 4i Project, is geared towards empowering a new generation of business owners, with a focus on youth and Small and Medium Enterprise (SMEs).

The Minister clarified the program’s eligibility, noting it is intended not only for emerging entrepreneurs but also for established SMEs that possess a minimum of three years of operational history and employ at least 10 individuals. The initiative will specifically target production-related businesses within identified districts across the nation.

He briefly outlined the main objectives of the project, stating the program seeks to expand business opportunities through entrepreneurship training and productivity enhancements.  He reaffirmed the Government’s commitment, stating that it has upheld its promise to support entrepreneurship and contribution to the development of the economy.

The Ministry of Industry and Entrepreneurship Development Deputy Minister Chathuranga Abeysinghe provided an explanation for the initiative’s name, confirming that the 4i Project framework refers to four distinct phases of business innovation and development.

He detailed these phases: Initiation, which focuses on helping aspiring entrepreneurs identify market opportunities and formulate initial business ideas; Ideation, which aids young people in developing their concepts into concrete business plans; Integration, which supports entrepreneurs in structuring and consolidating their business plans; and finally, Implementation, which guides entrepreneurs through the launch of their new business ventures.

Addressing the broader economic context, the Deputy Minister stated that low national productivity is one of the underlying reasons for the country’s economic downturn. He posed a question about the necessity of the project given that simply running an enterprise makes one an entrepreneur before explaining that the process is not merely about launching businesses, but about fundamentally improving them: increasing their efficiency, reducing waste, providing solutions, and ultimately making the enterprise truly entrepreneurial.

He stressed that only by significantly increasing productivity can Sri Lanka effectively penetrate the international market. He also reaffirmed the national target with expectations that this initiative will increase overall productivity by 52%.

Industry and Entrepreneurship Development Secretary J. M. Thilaka Jayasundara presented a detailed overview of the 4i Project, outlining its role in the Government’s strategy to reorient Sri Lanka towards a manufacturing economy by 2030.

She pointed out the project’s purpose and future actions, confirming it is an innovative initiative designed to boost the SME sector by enhancing the knowledge, skills, productivity, and export capability of local entrepreneurs.

She emphasised the ‘4i Project’ was initially implemented as a pilot program in the Gampaha District. The project success led to subsequently expanding the program across the entire island.

Jayasundara asserted that the Government is committed to transitioning to a manufacturing-led economy by 2030. Current figures show the manufacturing sector’s contribution is 16.1 %, while the contribution from entrepreneurs in the labour force stands at 3 %. The target is to raise the manufacturing sector’s contribution to at least 20% by 2030.

Acknowledging the goal’s significance, she described it as an optimistic yet achievable target, provided a collective effort is made to channel the manufacturing sector into the export market to drive growth.

Industry and Entrepreneurship Development Ministry’s  Public Enterprises Director W.M.D. Suranga Gunaratna noted that the ‘4i Project’ is specifically designed to strengthen the national economy by providing the selected young entrepreneurs and SMEs with the necessary advisory support, resources, training, and enhanced business knowledge required for sustainable growth and improved export performance.

He also mentioned the rigorous selection process that involved within a short period of time receiving applications from 17 districts, 968 candidates initially called for interviews. From that, 709 were selected, and 504 outstanding entrepreneurs ultimately secured their place in the first phase of the‘4i Project’ this year.

He confirmed the project’s phase covering 17 districts, with the remaining eight districts scheduled for mid-2026. He said their initial target was 1,000 participants and anticipate to select the remaining 500 entrepreneurs by next year. He noted that this successful launch is just a beginning, representing a major step toward strengthening Sri Lanka’s SME sector.

Addressing the extensive reach of the project, he mentioned that several other districts, eager to be a part of the initiative, had personally reached out, assuring them that their requests will be considered next year. He expressed his deep satisfaction that the opportunity is given to everyone, stating the ministry supports all prospective entrepreneurs.

A key highlight of the event was the presentation of appointment letters to selected entrepreneurs representing the 17 districts chosen for the initial rollout of the 4i Project this year. The launch event also featured a panel discussion where key personalities from public enterprises shared success stories and lessons learned from the successful pilot phase of the 4i Project, which was conducted in the Gampaha District. Attendees at the event included officials from the Ministry of Industries and Entrepreneurship Development, the Ministry of Public Administration, Provincial Councils and Local Government, officials of the National Productivity Secretariat, and representatives from the 17 participating districts.
