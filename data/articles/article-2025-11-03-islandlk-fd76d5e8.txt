Allianz Insurance Lanka lends its support to ‘Preserving Land and Nature’

In a decisive step that merges environmental responsibility with corporate purpose, Allianz Insurance Lanka Limited launched a groundbreaking partnership with the Wildlife and Nature Protection Society (WNPS) recently to support its Preserving Land and Nature (PLANT) initiative, a bold and science-driven conservation effort aimed at rebuilding Sri Lanka’s fragmented ecosystems.

The partnership marks a defining moment for the insurance sector in Sri Lanka, introducing a new model of sustainability-linked customer engagement. For every motor and travel insurance policy sold from October 30, 2025, Allianz Lanka will contribute funds—at no cost to customers—toward reforestation, habitat restoration and biodiversity conservation projects countrywide.

This is more than a CSR gesture; it is a strategic realignment of business and sustainability—a move that reinforces Allianz’s global commitment to ESG leadership, while setting a benchmark for responsible corporate citizenship in Sri Lanka.

“Allianz has always believed that protecting what matters most goes beyond insurance, it’s about safeguarding the planet and the future we all share, Prashant Grover, Chief Executive Officer and Country Manager of Allianz Insurance Lanka Limited, told journalists at a media briefing held at One Galle Face.

“At Allianz, we have a robust sustainability agenda centered on mind, body, and society. Our global ESG strategy focuses on achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 and reducing internal emissions by 70 percent by 2025 compared to 2019 levels, Grover explained, emphasizing that Allianz’s sustainability ethos is embedded within its operational DNA rather than confined to peripheral projects.

This partnership, Grover noted, is about creating shared value, turning every customer into a participant in climate action. “Through PLANT, we are giving our customers the opportunity to contribute directly to Sri Lanka’s environmental restoration and biodiversity conservation, without paying a cent more. It’s a meaningful way to extend the impact of insurance beyond financial protection to environmental protection.”

The PLANT initiative, founded under the umbrella of WNPS, the oldest and most active conservation organization in Sri Lanka focuses on building forest corridors to reconnect fragmented ecosystems, a challenge exacerbated by unplanned development.

“Many of Sri Lanka’s endemic species live outside protected areas, said Sriyan de Silva Wijeyeratne, chairperson of the PLANT initiative. “If we truly want to protect what’s uniquely ours, we must protect the habitats where our endemic species actually live. That’s why PLANT focuses on creating forest corridors that connect these ecosystems and allow wildlife to move safely.”

Unlike traditional tree-planting drives, PLANT takes a science-led ecosystem approach. “We are not about planting trees; we are about restoring ecosystems, Wijeyeratne emphasized. “Sometimes that means grasslands, sometimes forested patches, depending on the species and terrain. Our goal is ecological connectivity and biodiversity recovery.”

Since its inception, PLANT has established operations in 33 locations, securing over 2,500 acres and creating nearly 25 kilometers of forest corridors across the country. Current projects include the Budunwela Reforestation Project, protecting 24 acres critical for elephants and leopards and several corridor creation initiatives in the hill country plantations, where over 20 kilometers of habitat links are being restored in partnership with estate companies.

What makes this collaboration distinctive is its integration of sustainability into the core business model of an insurance provider. Rather than offering post-profit donations, Allianz Lanka has embedded environmental contribution directly into every policy.

From a business standpoint, Allianz’s partnership with WNPS represents a strategic response to the evolving market expectations surrounding ESG performance.

“Modern investors, customers, and regulators increasingly demand demonstrable environmental and social impact from companies, said a senior market analyst familiar with the insurance sector. “What Allianz has done is create an ESG-aligned product differentiation strategy—leveraging sustainability not just as a compliance metric, but as a driver of customer loyalty and brand equity.”

“Allianz Lanka is showing how corporates can bridge the gap between conservation and citizen communities, said Jehan CanagaRetna, Past President of WNPS. “They’ve moved beyond ad-hoc CSR to embed sustainability into their business. By sacrificing some short-term profits, they are creating a foundation for long-term environmental impact.”
