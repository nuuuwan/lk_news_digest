TikTok launches guide to combat misinformation during floods in Sri Lanka

TikTok has announced the launch of a new search guide designed to help users in Sri Lanka access authoritative and up-to-date information during the ongoing floods after cyclone Ditwah. As part of TikTok’s continued efforts to promote safety and factual awareness on its platform, the guide will provide verified information to counter misinformation trends surrounding natural disasters.

Users in Sri Lanka searching for flood-related updates on TikTok will now see a prominent banner urging them to verify information through credible sources. This guide connects users directly with the Disaster Management Centre (DMC) Sri Lanka, from where users in Sri Lanka can access verified information regarding natural disasters. The guide also connects users to TikTok’s Safety Center resources, and provides a direct link to TikTok’s Tragic Event Support guide, which offers practical support for individuals affected by distressing incidents.
