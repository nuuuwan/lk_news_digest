Commercial Bank launches ‘ComBank Shakthi’ to extend reach to customers

The Commercial Bank of Ceylon has taken another decisive step in its customer convenience journey with the launch of its Agency Banking operations, branded ‘ComBank Shakthi.’

This strategic initiative is designed to bring greater customer convenience and care to communities living far from towns, enhancing access to formal banking services across Sri Lanka.

In a banking landscape where accessibility and customer convenience are increasingly important, the Bank said its move into ComBank Shakthi represents a proactive response to customer needs in distant areas. The model allows the Bank to partner with selected third-party agents, typically local businesses or individuals, who act as intermediaries between the Bank and its customers, delivering core financial services without the need to establish fully-fledged branches.
