The untold story of Kiriamma Ulpatha – Sri Lanka’s Vanishing Myristica Swamp

Kiriamma Ulpatha is a rare freshwater swamp forest, one of the very few of its kind in Sri Lanka. It lies at the base of the Kaluganga Valley in the eastern slopes of the renowned Knuckles Mountain Range, a UNESCO World Heritage Conservation Area. The location is exceptionally significant due to the abrupt ecological transition between the mist-laden montane cloud forests and the dry semi-evergreen forests bathed in sunlight—an extraordinary habitat shift occurring over a short span of elevation.

The Knuckles Massif, celebrated for its high biodiversity and ecological value, also plays a key role in regional hydrology. Numerous springs, rivulets, and streams emerge from this range, feeding major rivers such as the Kalu Ganga, Heen Ganga, and Theligam Oya. Kiriamma Ulpatha stands out as a spring-fed swamp forest, reflecting the massif’s remarkable water-retaining geology and its intimate link with this forest ecosystem.

According to Mr. Dulan Madusanka Weerasekara, whose ancestral roots are linked to the area, this forest patch was once part of a vast natural landscape surrounding the remote village of Dagavilla. The village itself eventually vanished, for reasons still unclear, and the forest remained isolated for decades—known only to a few hunters and village elders—until new roads opened the area once more.

The situation changed dramatically with the Moragahakanda–Kaluganga multipurpose development project, which cleared large tracts of land for paddy fields, roads, and the resettlement town of Laggala. It was only after strong appeals from local residents that this remaining fragment of forest was spared.

Unique root adaptations of Horsfieldia iryaghedhi (Ruk) and Myristica ceylanica (Malaboda). These freshwater swamp forest trees develop stilt roots and knee roots (pneumatophores), features more commonly seen in mangroves.

The name Kiriamma Ulpatha comes from a perennial freshwater spring bubbling from the earth year-round. It forms the heart of this swamp forest, inundating flat terrain and feeding a network of slow-moving rivulets. The consistency of this flow even in the dry season indicates a stable underground aquifer, likely recharged by the rain-fed Knuckles Massif.

Freshwater swamp forests are globally rare, more commonly seen in Southeast Asia, tropical Africa, and South America. Vegetation in these forests is adapted to survive in waterlogged conditions. Freshwater swamp forests contain soft, unstable, and anoxic soil which may have influenced the evolution of unique root adaptations in these trees that resemble those seen in a real mangrove forest.

The exceptional Myristica swamps with dominant tree species belong to Myristicaceae (Nutmeg family) of India’s Western Ghats and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands are globally recognized for their evolutionary significance and are priceless possessions for evolutionary biology. With its entanglement of aerial roots, canopy of dark green large leaves, and high degree of endemism, the swamp is one of the most primeval ecosystems. The present day geographic distribution of the nutmeg family members is considered enough evidence of the origin of the family before the breakup of the Gondwanaland into present day landmasses and terms it as one of ‘living fossils’, which due to some favourable circumstances escaped extinction.

In Sri Lanka, very few freshwater swamp forests remain, mostly in the wet lowlands—such as the Walauwatta–Wathurana Swamp Forest—and they are considered the rarest wetland type in the country.

The discovery of Kiriamma Ulpatha as a rare Myristica swamp in a comparatively drier part of the island is therefore extraordinary. Its species composition differs from that of its Indian counterparts. Dominating its canopy are two endemic and threatened Myristicaceae species—Horsfieldia iryaghedhi (Ruk) and Myristica ceylanica (Malaboda). These remarkable trees have evolved special survival strategies to cope with swampy ground: stilt roots that anchor them firmly in soft soils, and knee roots, or pneumatophores, which rise above the surface to draw in oxygen from the air—an unusual feature more often seen in mangroves.

Through our fieldwork and observations, we identified Kiriamma Ulpatha as a rare type of Myristica swamp forest—a globally uncommon ecosystem. The dominance of key Myristicaceae species, their distinctive root adaptations, the swampy soil conditions, and the hydrological setting all provide compelling evidence for this classification. A review of scientific literature on freshwater swamp forests, including comparative studies from India and other countries, further supports these findings. This conclusion was also affirmed by veteran botanist, Mr. Sarath P. Ekanayake, who had previously taken part in a survey of this area.

“During my botanical survey in 2013, I came across a remarkable assemblage of large Myristicaceae trees within Kiriamma Ulpatha. The site represents a distinct freshwater swamp ecosystem—rare in Sri Lanka and ecologically comparable to the Myristica swamps of the Western Ghats. The survival of these water-loving trees in such a relatively dry landscape highlights the exceptional hydrological and ecological value of the area. Many similar swamp forests in valley bottoms have disappeared over time due to wetland conversion for paddy cultivation, making the conservation of this site particularly important.”

Beyond the nutmeg trees, the forest harbors an impressive array of nationally threatened species:

The faunal diversity is also notable, especially for such a small area. Endemic amphibians, reptiles, butterflies, and freshwater fish thrive here. One standout species is the endemic and endangered freshwater crab Oziotelphusa minneriyaensis.

Beyond its ecological and hydrological value, Kiriamma Ulpatha holds a deep cultural and spiritual significance.

Known today as sacred groves in western Ghats, India these Myristica swamp forests still hold high cultural and traditional value to communities, harkening back to a divine retribution with disturbing sacred forests, promoting long-term conservation through fear and respect.

Such taboos have been found to exist across the world and deep-rooted spiritual beliefs revered can sometimes act as powerful conservation tools.

Here in Kiriamma Ulpatha is dedicated to Goddess Pattini, who is worshipped for fertility and health. Locals believe it is protected by the spirit of Goddess Pattini, to whom rituals are still performed.

One folk tale recounts how a virtuous woman known as “Kiriamma” helped local villagers and was later deified.

Others claim the area to be the birthplace of Queen Kuveni of ancient Sri Lanka, as the Laggala region is believed to have been home to her historical Yakkha tribe.

Some traditions even state that the now-vanished village of Dagavilla was destroyed as divine punishment for stealing golden sickles gifted by the gods and for killing a sacred golden eel that lived in the spring.

Ancient ruins—stone pillars, pottery, and carvings—once existed in the area but were tragically destroyed by treasure hunters.

These sacred associations once protected the forest from human interference and can be powerful tools in reviving community-driven conservation today.

The Knuckles region, including Kiriamma Ulpatha, is one of the most critical areas for hydrological stability in Sri Lanka. With consistent rainfall feeding aquifers, springs, and river systems, this area ensures water availability for both ecosystems and people downstream. The persistent flow from Kiriamma Ulpatha even in dry months is proof of this vital connection.

Unfortunately, unsupervised human activity—ranging from destructive rituals to infrastructure development—now threatens the forest’s fragile balance.

Given its ecological uniqueness, cultural legacy, and hydrological importance, Kiriamma Ulpatha must be declared an Environmentally Protected Area. Such designation under national environmental regulations will provide it the legal recognition and management it urgently needs.

This forest is not just a biological relic—it is a symbol of our intertwined natural and cultural heritage. Its protection would honour generations of tradition, scientific knowledge, and the continuing efforts of the local people who fought to preserve it.
