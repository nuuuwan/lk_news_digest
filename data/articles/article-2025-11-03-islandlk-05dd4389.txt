Unforgettable 31st night in Colombo!

‘Dancing Through the Decades,’ at Cinnamon Life, is shaping up to be an unforgettable 31st night in Colombo!

In fact, the response to this gigantic New Year’s Eve event has been overwhelming, and Sohan is convinced that Cinnamon Life is heading for a sell out in early December.

It is all happening on 31st December, 2025, from 8:00 PM onwards, at the Lumina Ballroom, Cinnamon Life.

31st night revellers will have for company Sri Lanka’s top artistes, including Sohan Weerasinghe, Corrine Almeida, Geoffrey Fernando, Clifford Richard, Rukshan Perera, Damian Wickramatillake, and Falan Andrea, and dance enthusiasts can groove to the hits from the ’80s, ’90s, and 2000s, with two bands, Flame and AROH, driving the party forward.

The night, according to Sohan, will culminate in a dazzling countdown to welcome 2026, with a sumptuous gourmet buffet and traditional Sri Lankan breakfast to follow.

Sohan also mentioned that many expats are coming from Sydney, Melbourne and Perth, and also London and LA, for ‘Dancing Through the Decades.’

With an incredible lineup of artistes and a night full of music, dance, and celebration, it’s most certainly going to be a fantastic way to bid farewell to 2025 and welcome 2026 … at Cinnamon Life.
