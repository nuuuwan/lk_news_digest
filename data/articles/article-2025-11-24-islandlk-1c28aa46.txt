British School champs at ‘Step-Up’ 2025

‘Step-Up’ 2025, the first-ever Inter-International Schools Dance Competition, jointly organised by The British School in Colombo (BSC) and Asian International School (AIS), and held at the Lionel Wendt Theatre, in Colombo, saw The British School take the top spot.

According to reports coming my way, The BSC captivated the crowd with flawless contemporary and fierce hip hop, delivering championship worthy performances that set the stage on fire … an unforgettable victory for an unforgettable team.

Alisha Balasubramaniam, from AIS, was selected as the Best Contemporary Dancer for her breathtaking presence and grace on stage, while Kenuli Karunanayake, from The BSC, was selected as the Best Hip Hop Dancer for bringing unmatched energy and power.
