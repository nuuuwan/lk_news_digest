Development expert Hemachandra new UDA Chairman

In a key appointment for the nation’s urban planning sector, M.G. Hemachandra, a seasoned development expert, has been named Chairman of the Urban Development Authority (UDA).

Hemachandra brings extensive expertise from his tenure as a Senior Specialist and former Chief of Loan Projects at the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) in Sri Lanka. His career highlights include in-depth work in development policy analysis and formulation, economic development program and project design, implementation, and post-evaluation. A veteran in corporate governance, strategic planning, project management, procurement, and contract administration, Hemachandra’s insights extend to public discourse; last year, he authored a compelling opinion piece titled “Important Message for Presidential Candidates,” urging strategic focus on national priorities.

Prior to the JICA, Hemachandra served with the National Water Supply and Drainage Board and the Central Engineering Consultancy Bureau. He has been a dedicated council member of the Institution of Engineers Sri Lanka (IESL) for over 14 years, currently holding Fellow status and the role of Vice President. As the Founding Chairman of the IESL Policy Forum, he has championed engineering-driven policy discussions. Hemachandra also previously served as Vice President of the Association of Consulting Engineers Sri Lanka and sits on the Boards of Management and Advisory Councils for several prominent organisations.

His innovative contributions shone during the COVID-19 pandemic, when he created a demonstrative digital platform to support Mahaweli farmers with a team of volunteers. This initiative underscored his commitment to leveraging technology for rural development.

Academically, Hemachandra holds an MBA in Infrastructure Management, a B.Sc. Eng. (Hons) in Civil Engineering from the University of Moratuwa, a Diploma in Management from the Open University of Sri Lanka, and a Diploma in Commercial Arbitration from the Institute for the Development of Commercial Law and Practice (ICLP). He has also applied his skills as an adjudicator and mediator in construction sector disputes.

This appointment is expected to bolster Sri Lanka’s urban development initiatives with Hemachandra’s blend of technical prowess and policy acumen.
