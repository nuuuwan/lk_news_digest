The plan provides members the flexibility to choose their preferred retirement age between 45 and 70 years, offering a guaranteed monthly income that increases by 5% annually on a compounding interest basis. It also allows members to enhance their retirement fund according to their future needs and to receive up to five times their monthly pension as a health benefit each year, without the need for hospital or medical bills.
