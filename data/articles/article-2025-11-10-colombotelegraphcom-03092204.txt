When Reform Meets Impunity: The Troubling Conduct Of The Chairman Of Waters Edge Hotel

The National People’s Power (NPP) government came to office promising a new political culture—one defined by accountability, transparency, and freedom from patronage. It is precisely because of those promises that the growing controversy surrounding the Chairman of Waters Edge raises deep public concern. For a government elected on a mandate of integrity, the behaviour of a single appointee risks becoming a damaging symbol of the very political decay the NPP pledged to end.

Over the past months, employees, event organizers, and industry observers have voiced a series of disturbing allegations regarding the Chairman’s conduct, management style, and the rapid consolidation of personal power within the institution. These claims—still unanswered—deserve urgent scrutiny.

One of the earliest red flags emerged when a significant number of Waters Edge employees were abruptly dismissed. According to internal staff, they were labelled “rogues” without transparent inquiry or due process. Among those removed were senior figures, including the Director of Security, former DIG Chula de Silva, and a long-serving member of the Bakery division.

Yet, while ordinary employees were shown the door, allegations of misconduct within the Long Bar Club—where the Chairman is said to frequent—were reportedly ignored. Staff claim that those linked to these incidents remain shielded, raising questions about double standards and selective accountability.

One of the most serious allegations relates to an incident involving the assault of the son of a senior media executive. According to multiple accounts, a group of bouncers attached to Waters Edge allegedly attacked him so brutally that he required two surgeries. When several suspects were arrested, the Chairman is alleged to have threatened the OIC of the Welikada Police—a claim which, if substantiated, would represent a severe breach of law and democratic norms.

Employees report a troubling pattern of using public property and authority to advance private interests. The Chairman’s son’s band, Bulldogs, has reportedly been given privileged weekend performance slots at the Lounge bar, including promotion for major events. His close associates—particularly an individual frequently identified by staff as “Chakrapani”—are said to enjoy undue access and influence within the institution.

Further concerns center around the appointment of an allegedly inexperienced confidant, Iyantha Abeysinghe, as Acting CEO—raising questions about competence, fairness, and misuse of public office.

The Chairman publicly claims that Waters Edge is heading toward “historic profits” after a wave of dismissals. However, internal accountants and staff suggest that the opposite is true: that the institution may in fact be incurring losses masked through creative accounting. If these claims are correct, only a full, independent audit can reveal the true financial state of this public asset.

For many, the most perplexing aspect is the Chairman’s political rise. He reportedly cultivated relationships within NPP circles shortly before the election, presenting himself as a generous supporter. Critics argue that this proximity may have yielded him an influential appointment, despite his controversial past—including allegations of intellectual property theft and workplace disputes at his previous business ventures.

His frequent public declarations that the JVP “killed his family” but that he now wishes to help AKD “save the country” have also raised eyebrows. Whether this is genuine reconciliation or political posturing remains unclear.

The NPP cannot afford silence. Every unresolved allegation chips away at the credibility of a government that came to power vowing to dismantle impunity.

If the Chairman of Waters Edge is innocent, a transparent, independent inquiry will vindicate him.

If he is not, the government’s integrity demands decisive action.

Sri Lanka has suffered for decades under a political culture where power shields misconduct. The country voted for a break from that past. It is now the responsibility of the NPP leadership to ensure that this case does not become the first major test the government fails.
