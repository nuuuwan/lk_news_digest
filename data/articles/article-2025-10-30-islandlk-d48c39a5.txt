No populist budget expected, says analyst

Recent data from the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) shows the government’s strenuous yet successful efforts towards fiscal consolidation following the 2022 economic crisis.

The figures confirm a significant turnaround in public finances, driven by robust revenue performance and targeted expenditure control under the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) Extended Fund Facility (EFF) programme.

This revenue-based consolidation has been critical in restoring macroeconomic stability. However, a major challenge persists according to the data: the colossal burden of interest payments on the national debt.

Commenting on these trends, an economic analyst told The Island Financial Review that policy changes since mid-2022 are yielding substantial results after years of declining tax collection.

“The government’s revenue-to-GDP ratio has recovered strongly from its low point, demonstrating the efficacy of recent tax reforms,” he said. “This was achieved by enhancing the efficiency of tax administration and implementing rate adjustments, particularly with the revised Value Added Tax (VAT). This shift has bolstered the government’s ability to finance its operations and service its debt independently.”

Elaborating further, he noted mixed dynamics on the expenditure front. “While Non-Interest Expenditure as a share of GDP has been managed, signalling prudence in controlling operational spending, the overall expenditure profile remains dominated by the high cost of debt.”

“The core challenge is interest expenditure. Even as revenue grows, a disproportionately large share is immediately consumed by interest payments on the massive outstanding domestic and foreign debt,” he explained.

He pointed out that these high payments severely constrain the government’s capacity for vital capital investment and social welfare spending, effectively reducing the fiscal space available for economic stimulus.

“The sheer size of the debt means that interest payments will remain a major feature of the government’s fiscal dynamics for the foreseeable future, demanding continued fiscal discipline,” the analyst said.

He highlighted the attainment of a positive primary balance as the most significant achievement, marking a definitive turning point that validates the difficult fiscal measures undertaken in 2022-2023.

He concluded with a note of caution, stating that any policy reversal – particularly in tax revenue collection or expenditure control – could quickly undermine the progress made and push fiscal balances back into unsustainable territory.

“For Sri Lanka to fully exit the crisis, the government must continue to deepen tax administration reforms, maintain non-interest expenditure efficiency, and successfully execute its comprehensive debt restructuring programme. The fiscal sector’s performance is the cornerstone of the nation’s fragile recovery. In this context, the chances are remote that the upcoming Budget could be an ordinary people-friendly populist one.”

Presentation of Budget proposals for the year 2026 will be held on 7th November, 2025, followed by the budget debate from 8th November to 5th December, as decided by the Committee on Parliamentary Business.
