Customers also benefit from free technical advice on proper vehicle maintenance, delivered by Ideal Motors’ team of specially trained technical officers.

The initiative which began in Matugama, and has since extended to Puttalam, Chilaw, Ragama, Akkaraipattu, Galgamuwa, and Bandarawela. Special service camps have been arranged for Mahindra Bolero vehicles supporting safari tour companies.

As future engagement, service camps are scheduled at the Ideal Motors branches in Weligama and Ampara, followed by December sessions at Anuradhapura, Kurunegala, Matara, Morawaka, and Yapahuwa. The program will continue in multiple locations until March 2026, ensuring customers islandwide have access to professional care and maintenance.
