Initiative to launch next phase of market-oriented home gardens initiative

Partnership builds on previous successes to empower communities and strengthen livelihoods

The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and Hirdaramani Apparel have officially signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to launch the second phase of the collaborative Integrated Backyard Poultry and Market Development project, under UNDP’s Private Sector Giving Facility.

Initially launched in 2022 during the economic crisis, the initiative was designed to improve nutrition, increase income opportunities and build resilient communities through market-oriented home gardens and integrated backyard poultry.

This renewed partnership, implemented together with the Lacoste Foundation, builds on the success of the first phase, which supported more than 150 families in Vavuniya to enhance food security and economic opportunity. The project enables families to cultivate nutritious produce and engage in small-scale poultry farming, with access to direct markets through weekly community stalls at the Hirdaramani facility and local venues such as the Vanni Market in Vavuniya.

The second phase will continue to engage climate-vulnerable communities in Vavuniya Town and Vavuniya South DS divisions close to Hirdaramani’s operational footprint, further strengthening sustainable livelihoods and market linkages and livelihood development. Leveraging UNDP’s development expertise alongside Hirdaramani’s commitment to inclusive growth and the Lacoste Foundation’s focus on community empowerment, this collaboration creates a scalable model for sustainable market development across Sri Lanka.

This partnership reaffirms the vital role of private sector engagement in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and reflects a shared vision among all partners to invest in community dignity and livelihoods, driving long-term, positive change through inclusive and purpose-driven collaboration.
