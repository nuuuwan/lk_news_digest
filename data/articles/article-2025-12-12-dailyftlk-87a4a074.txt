EU commits  € 1.8 m in response to floods in Sri Lanka

In response to the devastating floods that have hit Sri Lanka, the EU has committed  € 1.8 million ($ 2 million) in emergency assistance for the most affected areas.

This funding will serve to provide essential relief to the most vulnerable communities.

European Member States are also providing in-kind assistance via the EU Civil Protection Mechanism. Germany has donated 4,600 shelter items, including tents, sleeping mats, and other items, while France has also announced their contribution through the mechanism. Italy is ready to send a team of engineering experts.

Furthermore, the EU activated its Copernicus Emergency Management Service (EMS) in rapid mapping mode (EMSR851), with some 30 maps produced so far.

“The recent floods in Asia have taken a very heavy toll, with too many lives lost and widespread destruction. With this assistance, we will support the most vulnerable communities to address their immediate needs and recover from this shock,” Preparedness and Crisis Management Commissioner Hadja Lahbib said.
