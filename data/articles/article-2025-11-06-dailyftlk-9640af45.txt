Inventive Polymers Lanka  celebrates seven years of  innovation, safety, and sustainability

Inventive Polymers Lanka Ltd., (IPL) celebrates its 7th anniversary, marking seven years of innovation, growth, and purpose-driven progress.

Founded in 2018 as a subsidiary of Stafford Motor Company Ltd., IPL has rapidly established itself as a leading name in Sri Lanka’s polymer manufacturing industry. With a clear mission to develop smart, sustainable solutions for a safer future, the company continues to push boundaries in both product innovation and local manufacturing.

As part of its ongoing growth, IPL has recently expanded its product portfolio to include a range of in-house manufactured items under its own flagship brand. These additions feature overalls, corporate T-shirts, and branded corporate gifts such as glass water bottles, key tags, caps, and more—all designed to meet evolving customer needs while maintaining IPL’s standards of quality and innovation.

Over the past seven years, IPL has pioneered advanced plastic injection moulding and testing capabilities, enabling the production of high-performance, recyclable polymer products for both domestic and international markets. The crown jewel of this journey is undoubtedly the company’s flagship innovation: SHAKO Helmets.

Born from IPL’s in-house R&D and a deep commitment to public safety, SHAKO is a premium, polymer-based helmet designed to meet the evolving needs of modern riders. Engineered with precision and tested under rigorous conditions, SHAKO helmets combine safety, style, and sustainability in one compelling product.

IPL Director Chavinka Sumanatilleke said: “SHAKO represents everything we stand for—innovation, integrity, and impact. It’s not just a helmet; it’s our promise to protect lives on the road while protecting the planet.”
