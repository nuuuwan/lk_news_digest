New national operations unit to shield Sri Lanka’s forests to be unveiled today

Sri Lanka will today unveil a major national initiative aimed at strengthening environmental protection, with the launch of the “Wana Surakuma” Integrated Operations Unit, a unified mechanism established to shield the country’s forests, wildlife and ecological heritage.

The initiative, introduced under the guidance of the President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, and led by Environment Minister Dr. Damika Patabendige, forms a central part of the government’s thrust toward building an environmentally responsible nation under the theme “A Sustainable Biosphere, An Evergreen Life.”

The unit will be officially launched today at the Wildlife and Forest Conservation Wing of the Environment Ministry premises,  Hector Kobbekaduwa Mawatha, Colombo 07. State Minister Anton Jayakody will join the proceedings.

“Wana Surakuma” brings together officers from the Forest Department, Department of Wildlife Conservation, the Police Special Task Force (STF) and the Tri-forces, enabling rapid and coordinated intervention against environmental crimes.

The public will be able to report illegal logging, forest fires, encroachments, wildlife crime and other threats through the 24/7 emergency hotline 1995, designed to ensure immediate action and reliable information flow.

A central operations hub will collect, classify and analyse data on forest and wildlife-related offences. The unit will employ drones, satellite imagery, GPS-based surveillance and real-time field communication to identify high-risk areas and monitor forest cover.

Dr. Ravindra Kariyawasam, Senior Advisor to the Ministry of Environment, highlighted the significance of the launch:

“For the first time, Sri Lanka is building a single, technologically empowered platform to detect, analyse and respond to environmental crimes in real time. This is not merely enforcement, it is a national shield for our forests, wildlife and biodiversity.”

The new system is expected to enhance evidence-gathering, strengthen legal processes and improve conviction rates in cases of environmental crime.

By centralising information and maintaining continuous surveillance, the operations unit aims to detect threats as they emerge  and even before they occur. This includes quicker mobilisation during wildfires, illegal land clearing and timber smuggling.

Dr. Kariyawasam said that the heightened monitoring will act as a strong deterrent, reducing the space available for offenders to operate.

The launch aligns with the government’s ongoing environmental policy reforms, which include reviewing outdated laws, aligning national regulations with international commitments, inviting public participation, and drafting new legislation where required.

A committee of experts is already overseeing these reforms under the Environment Ministry’s supervision. The “Wana Surakuma” unit is expected to serve as the operational backbone of the wider policy transformation.

Officials emphasise that the establishment of this integrated unit reflects a long-term national commitment to safeguarding Sri Lanka’s natural wealth.

“If we are to secure a sustainable future for our children, we must act decisively today. ‘Wana Surakuma’ marks a turning point,  where technology, expertise and public cooperation come together to defend our environment.”
