Sarvajana Trust launches as pathway to grassroots empowerment

The Sarvajana Trust, an independent trust fund dedicated to empowering women and youth across Sri Lanka, was officially launched last week in Colombo.

The event drew a distinguished gathering of ambassadors, business leaders, entrepreneurs, and supporters of the Sarvajana Balaya led by MP Dilith Jayaweera. It was well attended by individuals from across the country who are united in their belief that entrepreneurship lies at the heart of Sri Lanka’s journey to economic independence.

The Sarvajana Trust aims to uplift aspiring entrepreneurs by providing them with access to funding, mentorship, and essential resources needed to turn their ideas into viable enterprises. The Trust will operate through the Sarvajana Sabha framework, which has been established at the local government level, ensuring that support is channelled directly to those most in need at the grassroots.

In his keynote address, Principal Trustee Dilith Jayaweera said: “We are stepping away from conventional politics. Our belief has always been in an entrepreneurial nation. Our focus is on creating wealth for Sri Lankans, which is the most important factor in building a happier and more hopeful future.”

He emphasised the importance of mobilising the country’s human capital, adding, “By motivating our people, we convert liabilities into assets. The Sarvajana Trust is a tool that will activate real change and set the stage for an entrepreneurial state.”

He described the Trust as “a shared belief” and highlighted its foundation in patriotism, empathy, and accountability. He concluded with an invitation to all Sri Lankans to join in “making a positive, enduring, and impactful difference.”

Also speaking at the launch, Sarvajana Balaya Trustee and Secretary Ranjan Seneviratne, underscored the Trust’s strong commitment to transparency, governance, and accountability.

Sarvajana Balaya Trustee and National Organiser Dilum Amunugama highlighted that funds will be disbursed to deserving individuals at the community level - especially those with the drive and potential to uplift themselves and initiate transformation from the ground up.

The establishment of the Sarvajana Trust marks a significant step towards creating a more entrepreneurial, empowered, and economically resilient Sri Lanka.
