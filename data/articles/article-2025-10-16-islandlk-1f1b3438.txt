CPC chief answers United Petroleum: ‘We’ve honoured every condition under exit agreement’

Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) Managing Director Mayura Nettikumarage has firmly dismissed allegations by United Petroleum Lanka (Pvt) Ltd. (UPL) that the government failed to meet its obligations under an exit agreement, insisting that both CPC and the Ceylon Petroleum Storage Terminals Limited (CPSTL) have fulfilled all commitments made.

“CPC and CPSTL fulfilled all terms and conditions agreed in the interim period as well as at the exit. We are not sure what UP is asking again, Nettikumarage told The Island Financial Review, responding to a statement by the Australian-owned firm.

The dispute comes amid Sri Lanka’s continuing efforts to liberalise its fuel sector and attract credible international players. United Petroleum Lanka, a subsidiary of the United Petroleum Group of Australia, was among the first foreign entrants invited in 2024 to strengthen competition, efficiency and service delivery in the domestic market.

UPL’s arrival in August 2024 was seen as a milestone in the government’s bid to open the fuel retail industry to private investment. The company says it entered the market “with immense enthusiasm and commitment,” bringing technical expertise and international best practices from Australia’s highly competitive petroleum industry.

However, the company now alleges that its operations were undermined by the government’s failure to uphold critical contractual terms, creating an “uncertain and economically unsustainable environment.” After months of strain, UPL suspended fuel supply operations in December 2024 and initiated its exit process.

In April 2025, both parties entered into an exit agreement endorsed by the Cabinet, scheduled for completion in early May. UPL said it complied fully with the agreed terms and even extended deadlines to allow the government more time to deliver on its undertakings. Yet, a key obligation from the Ministry of Energy is seen as going unmet, prompting UPL to terminate the agreement and initiate formal dispute resolution proceedings in October 2025.

“United Petroleum Lanka’s entry into Sri Lanka began promisingly and collaboratively,” the company said in a statement. “But the difficulties we faced highlight the importance of policy consistency, openness, and adherence to contractual arrangements as Sri Lanka seeks to attract and retain foreign investment.”

UPL also expressed “deep disappointment” that the same challenges which plagued its operations were now affecting its exit, noting that such experiences send discouraging signals to potential foreign investors.

Nettikumarage, however, maintained that both CPC and CPSTL “acted in full compliance with every term of the operational and exit agreements” and accused the foreign investor of “raising fresh demands beyond what was mutually agreed and Cabinet-endorsed.”

The standoff is seen as highlighting the fragility of investor confidence in Sri Lanka’s ongoing energy market reforms. Analysts warn that protracted disputes of this nature could deter prospective foreign participants at a time when the government is seeking private capital and expertise to stabilise the energy sector.

understands that for now, both sides appear headed for a formal arbitration process, which could test not only the strength of Sri Lanka’s contractual governance but also its credibility in implementing market reforms that were meant to signal openness and reliability to the world.
