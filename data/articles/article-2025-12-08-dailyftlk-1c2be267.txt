Unity Plaza lights up Colombo’s digital future with largest triple-faced LED display

Launch marks culmination of Unity Plaza’s multi-year modernisation journey, positioning it at the centre of the nation’s advancing digital future and reinforcing its role as Sri Lanka’s leading technology hub

Colombo welcomed a new chapter in its urban landscape on 3 December as Unity Plaza revealed Sri Lanka’s largest outdoor LED digital screen, drawing a distinguished audience that included the Board of Directors and the Management of On’ally Holdings PLC, over 250 invitees, representatives from its international business partner and members of the media.

The unveiling signals the completion of Unity Plaza’s ambitious redevelopment journey that began with its relaunch in November 2023.

The towering triple-faced display, visible from Galle Road, Wellawatta and Station Road, elevates the building into one of the most striking digital structures in the country. It strengthens Unity Plaza’s prominence as the nation’s leading IT hub while reshaping Colombo’s commercial corridor with a contemporary visual identity.

Speaking at the launch, officials noted that the screen represents far more than an advertising platform, highlighting its role as a modern city landmark that elevates Unity Plaza’s architectural presence and strengthens its position as Sri Lanka’s foremost destination for technology products and services.

On’ally Holdings Managing Director M.H. Jamaldeen commented on the significance of the moment by stating, “This launch is not just about lighting up Colombo’s skyline. It reflects the spirit of innovation that continues to drive Unity Plaza’s evolution into Sri Lanka’s true IT hub. It stands as a symbol of progress, technology and national ambition.” He further noted, “This installation is more than a commercial display. It is a digital landmark that connects brands, citizens and the rhythm of the city in real time.”

The initiative brings together a blend of international and local expertise, with the LED system manufactured and supplied by Charming and Co., a globally recognised Chinese brand known for large-scale outdoor digital media solutions and advanced engineering standards, while installation was executed by the On’ally Holdings internal maintenance engineering team, reflecting strong Sri Lankan capability in managing a project of this scale and precision. This collaboration ensures robust performance, long-term reliability and seamless integration with the Unity Plaza building.

The launch is expected to reshape Sri Lanka’s Digital Out-of-Home landscape by offering marketers and technology brands a high-visibility platform that enhances Colombo’s modern identity while supporting real-time, dynamic content. It also marks the culmination of Unity Plaza’s multi-year modernisation journey, positioning the building firmly at the centre of the nation’s advancing digital future and reinforcing its role as Sri Lanka’s leading technology hub.
