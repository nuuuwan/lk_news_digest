New ADB report unveils major energy-saving potential for Sri Lanka’s key sectors

A new Asian Development Bank (ADB)-backed study has identified significant opportunities for Sri Lanka to reduce energy consumption, lower costs, and cut emissions by focusing on efficiency improvements in several high-demand sectors. The report, “Strengthening Knowledge and Actions for Air Quality Improvement – Sri Lanka Energy Efficiency Project,” highlights heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC), refrigeration, and lighting as the top priority areas for nationwide intervention.

The report estimates that commercial, household, and industrial facilities account for roughly 65% of the country’s total energy demand, making them critical to achieving national energy efficiency targets. Preliminary analysis suggests substantial savings: replacing 800,000 old household refrigerators alone could save an estimated 249 GWh of electricity annually, while upgrading outdated chillers in commercial buildings and hotels could save a further 105 GWh per year.

The study zeroes in on seven key sub-sectors for immediate attention: the tea and apparel industries, food and beverages, commercial buildings, hotels, household refrigeration, and agriculture (specifically solar water pumping). In the tea sector, introducing Variable Frequency Drives (VFDs) in withering processes and improving fuelwood boiler efficiency could slash energy use by 25-40%. For apparel and commercial buildings, replacing aging chillers and switching to LED lighting with smart controls offer some of the highest returns.

However, the report sounds a cautious note on the widespread shift from fossil fuels to fuelwood in industries. While financially attractive due to a growing price gap, the study warns that a rapid increase in demand could lead to unsustainable deforestation, creating a future “environmental disaster” unless supply is carefully managed.

To unlock these savings, the report proposes a dedicated financing project managed by a Project Implementation Unit (PIU). The Ministry of Finance would channel ADB funds through participating banks to businesses and households. A key recommendation is the revival of a loan guarantee facility to help small and medium enterprises (SMEs), which often lack collateral, access credit for energy upgrades.

The report also identifies major hurdles: SMEs face credit and technical capacity constraints, and monitoring the savings from countless small projects is complex. Establishing a strong PIU with technical experts is deemed essential for success.

Sri Lanka’s heavy reliance on imported fossil fuels, which accounted for 51% of primary energy supply in 2021, places a severe strain on foreign exchange reserves. The recent energy crisis and subsequent sharp tariff hikes have made improving efficiency a pressing economic and political imperative.
