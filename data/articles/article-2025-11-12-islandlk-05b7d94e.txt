DFCC Bank to acquire Standard Chartered Bank’s Wealth and Retail Banking Business in Sri Lanka

DFCC Bank PLC (“DFCC Bank”) is pleased to announce that it has entered into a binding Business Sale Agreement with Standard Chartered Bank, United Kingdom, acting through its branch in Sri Lanka (“SCB Sri Lanka”), to acquire the wealth and retail banking business of SCB Sri Lanka.

The proposed acquisition covers all of SCB Sri Lanka’s wealth and retail banking business, which includes Priority Banking, credit cards, retail lending, deposits and SME. The transaction ensures that all SCB Sri Lanka’s wealth and retail banking employees will be provided comparable roles and opportunities to continue to grow and further their careers within DFCC Bank. Together, DFCC Bank and SCB Sri Lanka will ensure seamless transition of both customers and staff, and continuity of service and relationships throughout the integration process.

The proposed acquisition forms part of DFCC Bank’s long-term strategy to strengthen its retail and wealth management proposition, broaden its customer base, and build scale in key growth segments. The transaction will be funded entirely through internally generated capital, reflecting DFCC Bank’s strong financial foundation and disciplined approach to expansion.

Thimal Perera, Director/Chief Executive Officer of DFCC Bank, said, “We look forward to welcoming customers and colleagues of Standard Chartered Bank’s retail banking and wealth management operations in Sri Lanka into the DFCC Bank family. As we mark 70 years of banking, this strategic milestone deepens our conviction in Sri Lanka’s potential and reinforces our long-standing commitment to supporting the economy and, most importantly, all Sri Lankans. This acquisition is not merely about scale. It is about extending our purpose: to enable meaningful growth, deliver real value, and uphold the trust of every stakeholder we serve – from individuals and businesses to the SMEs that form the backbone of our nation’s economy.” (DFCC Bank)
