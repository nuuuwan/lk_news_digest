The Sri Lanka–Maldives Business Council (SLMLBC) of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, in collaboration with the Sri Lanka Export Development Board (EDB) and the Sri Lanka High Commission in the Maldives, organised a Sri Lankan business delegation to participate in the prestigious Hotel Asia Exhibition and International Culinary Challenge 2025, held in Hulhumalé, Maldives, from 20 to 22 October.

The 19th edition of this internationally recognised event reinforced its reputation as the Maldives’ largest and most influential hospitality trade exhibition. The accompanying International Culinary Challenge, brought together leading chefs and emerging culinary talents from across the archipelago for exciting live competitions.

Since its inception in 2000, Hotel Asia has evolved into one of the region’s premier hospitality and trade showcases—expanding from just 42 stalls and 37 chefs to over 300 stalls and participants from 48 countries, including the Maldives, Sri Lanka, India, China, Thailand, UAE, USA, and Switzerland. The event served as a dynamic platform for industry professionals, innovators, and entrepreneurs to connect, collaborate, and explore new opportunities.

Taking centre stage at the event, Sri Lanka showcased a vibrant national pavilion featuring over 48 Sri Lankan companies, organised by the Sri Lanka–Maldives Business Council (SLMBC) in collaboration with the Export Development Board (EDB). The pavilion highlighted Sri Lanka’s innovation and expertise across sectors such as food, hospitality, wellness, and sustainable products. This initiative aims to further strengthen bilateral business relations and promote Sri Lankan enterprises within the Maldivian market, in line with the Maldives’ ongoing tourism expansion and growing demand for quality regional products and services.

The opening ceremony of the Hotel Asia Exhibition and the Sri Lankan Pavilion took place on 20 October 2025 and was graced by High Commissioner of Sri Lanka to the Maldives M.R.
