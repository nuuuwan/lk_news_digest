CFA Society Sri Lanka has announced that applications are now open for the August 2026 CFA Institute Program Access Scholarships. The CFA Institute Access Scholarship Program is a global initiative designed to make the prestigious CFA Program more accessible to individuals who may not be able to afford the full program fees, while adhering to the mission and values of the CFA Institute. The Access Scholarship provides substantial financial support by reducing enrolment and exam registration fees, enabling a broader range of aspiring professionals to pursue the CFA designation.

CFA Society Sri Lanka President Rashmi Peiris Paranavitane, CFA, stated that the Access Scholarship continues to play a vital role in strengthening Sri Lanka’s future financial talent pool. She emphasised that the CFA designation is globally recognised for its rigor and credibility, and that this scholarship opens doors for ambitious individuals who may otherwise find the cost of the program a barrier.

CFA Society Sri Lanka Director and Chair of the University Outreach Committee, Nuwan Jayawardana, CFA, highlighted that the initiative aims to empower university students aspiring to enter the finance profession, existing industry professionals seeking to enhance their credentials, and individuals from other industries who are looking to transition into the field. He encouraged all those aspiring to earn the CFA charter to apply, noting that this opportunity can significantly enhance their professional growth and global competitiveness.

Applications for the August 2026 exam cycle, which includes Levels I, II, and III, will be accepted from 11 November 2025 and will close on 1 December 2025. Applicants will be notified directly via email approximately four weeks after the application window closes.
