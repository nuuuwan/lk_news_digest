The George Keyt Foundation has extended meaningful support to the Government of Sri Lanka’s disaster relief efforts following the severe devastation caused by Cyclone Ditwah.

In 2023, the Foundation undertook its first major fundraiser in recent years by issuing 30 numbered limited edition prints of Kangodi Rangi, a painting by George Keyt entrusted to the Foundation. Twenty-eight prints were acquired by donors to support charitable causes, while another was gifted to the President’s collection. Print number 1 of 30 was retained to support the Foundation’s long-term priorities.

In light of the unprecedented impact of Cyclone Ditwah and the urgent national need for disaster assistance, the trustees unanimously resolved to seek a donor for Print number 1of 30, with clear disclosure that the proceeds would be channelled directly to the Government’s disaster relief program. This appeal received an immediate response, resulting in a private donation of Rs. 3 million.

The contribution was formally handed over to Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya for utilisation in the Government’s ongoing relief and recovery efforts.

The George Keyt Foundation is honoured to support the people of Sri Lanka at this critical moment and reaffirms its commitment to serving national needs while preserving and promoting the artistic legacy of George Keyt.
