Sri Lanka Ports Authority to remit Rs. 5 b to Consolidated Fund amid record profits

The Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) is set to remit Rs. 5 billion to the Consolidated Fund this year, marking a significant increase in its contribution following a sharp rise in profitability under the new administration.

According to a statement issued by the Ports and Civil Aviation Ministry, the State-owned entity has generated a net profit after tax of Rs. 39 billion as of 31 October 2025, reflecting an improvement of nearly Rs. 12 billion compared to the previous year.

The authority noted that this performance represents the strongest financial turnaround in its recent history.

It said for decades up to 2024, SLPA’s cumulative contribution to the Consolidated Fund amounted to just Rs. 10.3 billion. In contrast, the Authority will transfer Rs. 5 billion in 2025 alone, signalling a dramatic shift in its financial role.

The first tranche of Rs. 2 billion was remitted in September 2025, while the remaining Rs. 3 billion is scheduled to be transferred in December.

It attributed the improved profitability to strengthened operational efficiencies, better revenue management, and reforms initiated by the Government. The enhanced contributions would support fiscal consolidation efforts and reinforce the Ports Authority’s position as a key revenue-generating State enterprise.

Volumes at the main port of Colombo has seen moderate improvement this year.

Container volumes at the Port of Colombo rose 6.7% year-on-year to nearly 6.2 million TEUs in the first nine months of 2025, driven by growth in both transhipment and domestic handling, Central Bank data showed. September throughput increased 14.4% to 742,116 TEUs and was broadly unchanged month-on-month. Transhipment volumes were up 4.8% to 4.94 million TEUs in the nine-month period, while domestic handling rose 13.6% to 971,875 TEUs. Vessel traffic across all ports increased 12.6% to 3,792 ships.

The Government has announced several capacity-expansion and efficiency initiatives in the 2026 Budget, including Phase II of the Western Container Terminal, feasibility work on Port Logistics Centres and preparatory work for the Colombo North Port Development Project, alongside expanded digitalisation and a new Customs verification centre.

However, exporters have warned that recurring vessel omissions at Colombo are disrupting production schedules, with manufacturers reporting shortages of raw materials, delays and higher costs. The Free Trade Zone Manufacturers’ Association has called for urgent operational improvements and faster commissioning of new terminals to stabilise port performance.
