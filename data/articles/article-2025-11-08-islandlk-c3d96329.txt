A wake-up call for Charith Asalanka?

Sri Lanka’s cricket has been through the wringer since missing out on the Champions Trophy, but there’s finally a sense that the ship is being steadied. Pathum Nissanka is our big hope like Aravinda de Silva was in the good old days.

The side has been moving forward with calculated precision — ticking boxes, planning long-term and more importantly, stacking up some prized scalps. Beating world champions Australia in an ODI series this year was the icing on the cake after that memorable series win over India last season.

The Asia Cup, however, proved that the road to redemption is still full of potholes. After a promising start, Sri Lanka ran out of steam in the Super Four — losing to Bangladesh and Pakistan, while the high-scoring tie against India only rubbed salt into the wounds. It was a classic case of doing the hard work early and then taking the foot off the pedal when it mattered most.

When it comes to leadership, Sri Lanka has usually played a straight bat. Arjuna Ranatunga, Mahela Jayawardene, Angelo Mathews — all were nurtured carefully, learning the ropes before being handed the reins. Charith Asalanka followed a similar trajectory, rising through the ranks with promise. Of course, there have been odd instances when a senior player parachuted into the job, but those short-term experiments rarely stood the test of time.

Asalanka, though a natural leader, had a mixed outing at the Asia Cup. His decision to toss the ball to Dunith Wellalage for the final over against Mohammad Nabi nearly cost Sri Lanka the match — only Kusal Mendis’ composure saved the day. But lightning doesn’t always strike twice. Other tactical missteps, especially his hesitation to use Dasun Shanaka in crunch overs while trusting his college mate Kamindu Mendis instead, raised eyebrows in the dressing room and beyond.

With the bat, Asalanka has been one of the mainstays in the 50-over format, but his T20 returns have been scratchy at best. The selectors, never ones to mince words, have sent a subtle but sharp message. When naming squads for the Pakistan tour, they left the vice-captaincy slot blank in ODIs — but handed it to Shanaka in T20s. The writing, as they say, is on the wall.

Asalanka is no mug with the bat or with leadership, but he’s got to tighten a few screws — literally and figuratively. His fitness remains a talking point and appearances do him no favours. Yet, under the watchful eye of Sanath Jayasuriya, now Head Coach, he’s begun to address a few key areas. He deserves a fair run — at least till the World Cup Sri Lanka co-hosts with India.

As for Dasun Shanaka’s return as deputy, one wonders whether that’s a backward step. Shanaka has worn the armband before and the team seems to have turned the page. His experience will be handy, no doubt, but leadership is a baton best passed forward, not back. When Dunith Wellalage returns to the mix, it might be time to groom him as the next in line. Like Arjuna, MJ, Angelo and now Charith, Wellalage too has come through the system, learning the trade ball by ball.

For Asalanka, this might just be the nudge he needs — the well-timed bouncer that wakes a batsman up. If he plays it right, he could pull it for six. If not, the selectors might already have the next captain warming up in the nets.
