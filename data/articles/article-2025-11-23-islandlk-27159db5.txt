TVS Lanka empowers 210 garage mechanics with free NVQ certifications

In a significant boost for Sri Lanka’s automotive sector, TVS Lanka certified 210 Private Garage Mechanics (PGMs) with NVQ Level 4 qualifications at a ceremony held at the BMICH on October 29.

The technicians received their certifications free of charge through the TVS Knowledge Centre, the country’s only private institute officially recognized by the government to offer NVQ Level 4 certification for motorcycle technicians in collaboration with NAITA and the Tertiary and Vocational Education Commission (TVEC).

This initiative marks a major milestone in public-private partnerships for vocational training, directly addressing the need for standardized, high-quality skills development within the two-wheeler industry.

“TVS is delighted to contribute to transforming the country’s most valuable asset- its human resources,” said Geethal Anthony, CEO of TVS Lanka. He emphasized the Centre’s role as a catalyst for upskilling aspiring technicians for a modernized mobility landscape.

The company highlighted that providing this advanced training and certification at no cost is a core part of its mission to uplift the Sri Lankan automobile workforce, enabling them to compete globally.

The landmark event was attended by Chief Guest G. Srinivasan Raghavan, Director of TVS Lanka and Chairman & Managing Director of TVS Mobility Pvt. Ltd, India, alongside other dignitaries.
