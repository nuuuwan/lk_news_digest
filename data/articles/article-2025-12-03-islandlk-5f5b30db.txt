Chec Port City Colombo extends Rs. 10 million and critical on-ground support to national recovery efforts following Cyclone Ditwah’s devastation

As Sri Lanka confronts the heartbreaking aftermath of Cyclone Ditwah, one of the most devastating natural disasters in the nation’s recent history, the country has witnessed people and organisations coming together in an extraordinary show of solidarity. With thousands of families displaced, communities destroyed, and critical infrastructure severely damaged, CHEC Port City Colombo (Pvt) Ltd. has stepped forward to extend critical financial and on-ground assistance.

In response to this urgent national emergency and unprecedented humanitarian crisis, the company has donated Rs. 10 million to the Government’s newly established ‘Rebuilding Sri Lanka’ Fund, a statutory mechanism under the Presidential Secretariat dedicated to long-term reconstruction, rehabilitation, and restoration of critical infrastructure.

“In this time of deep national sorrow, our hearts are with every Sri Lankan family affected by this tragedy,” said Xiong Hongfeng, Managing Director, CHEC Port City Colombo (Pvt) Ltd. “Sri Lanka has been a trusted partner for decades. Today, we stand with its people, not merely as developers, but as friends, neighbours, and long-term partners committed to rebuilding lives and communities.”

The donation was officially handed over by Mr. Xiong Hongfeng to Dr. Harshana Suriyapperuma, Secretary to the Treasury, at the Ministry of Finance. The Colombo Port City Economic Commission (CPCEC) facilitated the process as the regulatory authority for Port City Colombo.

Beyond financial support, CHEC Port City Colombo (Pvt) Ltd. has mobilized a fleet of 12 critical disaster-response machinery, including loaders, excavators, backhoes, flatbed trucks, and dump trucks, ready for rapid deployment to government-designated areas to accelerate debris clearance, restore access, and support emergency rescue operations.
