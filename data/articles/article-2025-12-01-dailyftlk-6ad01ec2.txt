China issues condolences; says support on the way to SL

China has extended its heartfelt condolences to the victims and sincere sympathies to the bereaved families and flood-stricken people in Sri Lanka following the devastating cyclone which hit across the country last Thursday.

“China’s assistance and support to Sri Lanka is on the way. China’s solidarity and support for the Government and the people of Sri Lanka,” said the Embassy of the People’s Republic of China.

In recent days, severe floods and landslides triggered by Cyclone Ditwah have caused substantial casualties and extensive property damage. The people of China share the grief of those affected in Sri Lanka.

To support the disaster relief efforts by Sri Lankan brothers and sisters, the Red Cross Society of China has disbursed $ 100,000 in emergency cash aid to the Sri Lanka Red Cross Society, and emergency assistance from the Chinese Government is underway.

Meanwhile, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce and the Overseas Chinese Association in Sri Lanka launched donation initiatives and so far have collected Rs. 10 million in total for the affected regions.

“We are confident that, under the firm leadership of President Anura Kumara Dissanayake and with the collective support of the international community, the valiant Sri Lankan people will undoubtedly overcome the disaster, stand united in solidarity and rebuild their homes in the near future,” the embassy said.
