Visiting Indian External Affairs Minister Dr. S. Jaishankar yesterday met Prime Minister Harini Amarasuriya at Temple Trees in Colombo.

Dr. Jaishankar is in Sri Lanka as the Special Envoy of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The meeting took place during his official visit to engage Sri Lanka’s senior leadership as the country begins reconstruction following the destruction caused by Cyclone Ditwah.

During discussions, Dr. Jaishankar reiterated India’s willingness to support Sri Lanka’s recovery efforts, including assistance for rebuilding railways and bridges and strengthening the agricultural sector. He also stressed the importance of effective disaster-response systems underpinned by strong legislative, administrative and institutional frameworks.

According to a statement from the Prime Minister’s Office, the two sides reviewed ongoing relief measures and discussed ways to deepen bilateral cooperation in disaster response and recovery.

Prime Minister Amarasuriya expressed appreciation for India’s continued assistance, noting that post-Ditwah recovery extends beyond immediate relief to longer-term priorities such as resettlement and the reconstruction of housing and infrastructure. She said steps have been taken to reopen schools as part of restoring normalcy, with close monitoring in place.

The Prime Minister also underscored the need to ensure stability, reduce vulnerability and strengthen protection mechanisms, while highlighting public solidarity, volunteerism and collective action shown during the emergency.

The meeting was attended by Indian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka Santosh Jha, Additional Secretary (IOR) at India’s Ministry of External Affairs Puneet Agrawal, Joint Secretary (EAMO) Sandeep Kumar Bayyapu, and Deputy High Commissioner Satyanjal Pandey.

The Sri Lankan delegation included Secretary to the Prime Minister Pradeep Saputhanthri, Additional Secretary Sagarika Bogahawatta, Director General (South Asia) at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Samantha Pathirana, and Deputy Director, South Asia Division Diana Perera.
