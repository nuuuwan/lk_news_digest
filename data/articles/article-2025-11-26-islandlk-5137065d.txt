Launch of digital ticketing solution for Sri Lankan commuters

People’s Bank, in collaboration with the Ministry of Transport, Highways and Urban Development, has launched a groundbreaking initiative that marks a significant milestone in Sri Lanka’s journey toward a fully digital public transport ecosystem. The new solution enables commuters to conveniently pay for their transport fares using their bank cards, eliminating the need for cash and enhancing the overall commuter experience.

The launch event took place at the Makumbura Multimodal Centre under the patronage of Minister Bimal Ratnayake, who commended the initiative as a key step in modernizing the country’s transport infrastructure. The event was graced by the presence of People’s Bank CEO/General Manager Clive Fonseka.

This innovative system goes beyond just cashless payment. It includes a digital ticketing solution that streamlines the fare collection process, offering greater efficiency, transparency, and accountability across the transport network.

The initiative will be rolled out as a pilot project, with plans for wider expansion across multiple transport modes following successful implementation and commuter feedback. By enabling seamless, secure, and convenient digital payments, People’s Bank aim to support bringing lasting improvements to Sri Lanka’s transport landscape.

This collaboration reflects People’s Bank’s ongoing efforts to empower citizens through digital financial solutions and support the government’s broader vision for a smart, connected Sri Lanka.
