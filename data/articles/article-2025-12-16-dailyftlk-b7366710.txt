Lankem Agro, has announced the launch of three breakthrough fertiliser innovations, Vovo K Power, Wonder K, and N-Shield Dual Urea marking a significant advancement in sustainable and efficient crop nutrition.

These next-generation solutions reinforce the company’s purpose of nurturing growth, enriching lives, and empowering farmers through scientifically driven, practical technologies designed to enhance productivity while protecting soil health.

Vovo K Power represents a fourth-generation high-potassium granular fertiliser, formulated with a balanced NPK 10:05:25 ratio and enriched with ten bio-active components. Suitable for paddy, maize, fruits, and vegetables, it offers farmers versatile application options from granular use to foliar, drip, or drone applications, helping achieve higher yields, improved crop quality, and enhanced soil vitality. Wonder K, a high-potassium foliar fertiliser imported from Ukraine, combines 2% Boron and 15% Sulfur in a fully water-soluble formulation. It is particularly effective for maize and vegetable cultivation, delivering rapid and visible improvements during the flowering and grain-filling stages, strengthening crop uniformity and resilience under stress conditions. N-Shield Dual Urea introduces a new standard in nitrogen efficiency through the use of urease and nitrification inhibitors. This technology enables farmers to reduce the use of traditional urea by up to 40% while maintaining or increasing yields, significantly minimising nitrogen losses, safeguarding groundwater, and promoting long-term environmental sustainability.

These innovations reflect Lankem Agro’s unwavering commitment to “Growing with the Nation,” as the company continues to integrate scientific advancement with sustainable agricultural practices. By delivering nutrient technologies that reduce wastage, improve efficiency, and protect natural resources, Lankem Agro supports the ongoing transformation of Sri Lanka’s agricultural sector toward a more resilient and productive future.

Lankem Agro Chief Executive Officer Nishantha Jayamanne said: “At Lankem Agro, our mission is to make modern farming accessible to every Sri Lankan farmer. With these new products, we are giving them the tools to achieve more higher yields, stronger crops, and a healthier planet.”

As a pioneer in crop protection and nutrition, Lankem Agro remains dedicated to enhancing agricultural productivity through innovation, partnership, and trust. Guided by its purpose of nurturing sustainable growth for future generations, the company continues to develop solutions that empower farmers and contribute meaningfully to national food security.
