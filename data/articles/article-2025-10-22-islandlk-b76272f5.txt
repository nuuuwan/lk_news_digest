Boldly flavored burgers arrive in Sri Lanka with Domino’s The Dominator

Domino’s, the world’s largest pizza brand, has expanded its offering in Sri Lanka with the launch of its first-ever burger platform – The Dominator. This marks a milestone for the brand, introducing burgers to the Sri Lankan market for the very first time, while staying true to its promise of freshness and quality delivered “from our oven to your hands.”

The move comes as demand for high-quality, innovative quick-service meals continues to grow in Sri Lanka. Domino’s identified an opportunity to meet this demand with a burger platform that emphasises freshness, bold flavors, and an elevated consumer experience.

At the heart of The Dominator is the freshly baked bun, prepared in Domino’s own factories and sprinkled with herbs for added flavor. Every burger is crafted in-store with Domino’s signature touch, combining two types of cheese sauces, ketchup, mustard, and fresh vegetables including onion, tomato, and jalapeños.

Commenting on the launch, Vijaya Bhaskar, Director/Country Head of Domino’s Sri Lanka, said: “The Dominator represents an important step in our journey to diversify the Domino’s experience in Sri Lanka. Burgers are a growing category in the market, and we are confident that our unique approach – from baking herb-infused buns to preparing each burger fresh in-store – will set a new standard for quality and taste. This launch gives our customers greater choice while staying true to the core values that define Domino’s.”
