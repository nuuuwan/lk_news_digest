Sri Lankan delegation participates in CII Partnership Summit 2025 in Andhra Pradesh

The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, together with the Indo-Lanka Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ILCCI), successfully led a high-level Sri Lankan business delegation to the prestigious CII Partnership Summit 2025 held in Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh.

The Partnership Summit, organised annually by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), is recognised as a premier global forum that brings together India’s top political leadership, senior policymakers, industry leaders, and a large contingent of international delegates.

The Sri Lankan delegation, comprising representatives from a diverse range of sectors, was led by Ceylon Chamber of Commerce CEO Buwanekabahu Perera. The delegates attended the ceremonial inauguration of the Summit, which was graced by several eminent dignitaries including Vice-President C.P. Radhakrishnan, Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu, and other senior officials from the Government of India.

Throughout the Summit, the delegation participated in a series of high-level sessions focused on global trade, investment, digital transformation, and regional cooperation. These forums provided valuable insights into India’s evolving economic landscape, emerging opportunities, and sectoral priorities.

Complementing these sessions, Sri Lankan delegates also engaged in a structured series of Business-to-Business (B2B) meetings with both Indian and international companies. These interactions facilitated direct linkages between Sri Lankan enterprises and potential partners across multiple industries, opening doors to trade partnerships, joint ventures, investment collaboration, and technology exchange.

The mission played a pivotal role in strengthening commercial connectivity between Sri Lanka and India. It further highlighted the commitment of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce and the Indo-Lanka Chamber of Commerce and Industry to support member companies, expand regional cooperation, and position Sri Lanka as a dynamic competitor in the global marketplace.

The Chambers emphasised that continued participation in platforms such as the CII Partnership Summit is essential for enhancing Sri Lanka’s economic diplomacy efforts, improving market access, and creating long-term growth opportunities for the country’s business
