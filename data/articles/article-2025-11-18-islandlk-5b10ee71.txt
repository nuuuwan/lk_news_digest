LowePublic presents NEQ, the podcast celebrating the Power of Unequal

LowePublic, the Public Relations arm of the MullenLowe Group Sri Lanka, is expanding its reach in digital PR with the launch of NEQ – Not Equal To, a podcast curated to showcase professionals, brands and organisations who have performed extraordinarily by punching above their weight class and are not equal to others. Scheduled to debut across major social and streaming platforms in late November 2025, this initiative signals a bold evolution in how LowePublic connects with audiences through digital storytelling.

Hosted by Imran Saibo, the visionary founder of Funtime and a pioneer with over 30 years of expertise in bridging business and experience, NEQ unites distinct voices for conversations that challenge, provoke, and uncover perspectives that remain unseen in traditional media. Imran, a professional in economics and a pioneering figure in event marketing, will anchor the series, drawing out the essence of success from each guest, whether an individual, organisation or a brand that has redefined its category. Through sleek production, minimalist aesthetics, and sharp sound design, NEQ ventures beyond surface-level narratives to uncover the ideas, tensions, and legacies that shape not only remarkable individuals but also the visionary brands and enterprises transforming their worlds.

Commenting on the launch, Lakshika Gunatilake, Head of Public Relations at LowePublic said, “NEQ represents a natural progression for LowePublic as we expand our storytelling canvas beyond traditional PR. At its core, NEQ is about those who’ve built, failed, led, and dared differently. We wanted to create a space where their stories could breathe without being edited down to soundbites. That’s where real connection happens, and that’s the heart of what we do at LowePublic.”

“In a world where everyone’s talking, NEQ is listening for what actually matters. NEQ is about the thinkers and doers who don’t fit the mould and never needed to.” said Imran Saibo, host of NEQ Season One.

The launch of NEQ represents a new chapter in LowePublic’s journey as a leading Public Relations agency. It reflects a deliberate move toward long-form digital storytelling where meaning matters more than metrics while embodying the challenger spirit that drives the MullenLowe Group.

NEQ will launch in late November 2025 and will be available on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and LinkedIn.
