Flexiprint Ltd., a trailblazer in Sri Lanka’s printing and packaging industry, has celebrated yet another landmark achievement by securing the Best Exporter Award (sectoral) at the Presidential Export Awards 2024/25. This accomplishment marks an extraordinary milestone, as the company has now won this prestigious honour for the fourth consecutive year — and an impressive 12 Presidential Export Awards in total. The award was presented by the Sri Lanka Export Development Board (EDB), under the patronage of Sri Lanka Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya, with Industries Minister Sunil Handunneththi gracing the ceremony held at the BMICH.

The Presidential Export Awards (PEA) represent the highest and most distinguished recognition bestowed by the President of Sri Lanka to acknowledge exporters who have made exceptional contributions to the national economy. Organised annually by the Sri Lanka Export Development Board (EDB), the awards program highlights outstanding performance, export excellence, global competitiveness, and long-term commitment to the country’s export sector. The 27th Presidential Export Awards ceremony, held on 11 December, celebrated the achievements of leading exporters for the financial year 2024/2025. Among these top performers, Flexiprint stood out once again, reaffirming its position as one of Sri Lanka’s most dynamic and export-driven industrial leaders.

Founded in 1994 by Sathis Abeywickrama, Flexiprint began its journey as a modest printing operation with a simple yet ambitious vision — to bring world-class printing and packaging solutions to Sri Lanka. Over the past three decades, the company has evolved into a globally trusted enterprise, supplying premium-quality tea bag tags, envelopes, pyramid mesh with tags, labels, and FMCG packaging to both domestic and international markets.

Today, Flexiprint is widely recognised for its exceptional precision, reliability, and commitment to innovation. Its products are used by some of the world’s most respected tea brands and FMCG companies, who rely on the company for consistent quality, timely delivery, and advanced printing technologies. This sustained global demand has been a major catalyst behind Flexiprint’s recurring success at the Presidential Export Awards.

Founder and Managing Director Sathis Abeywickrama said: “We are truly honoured to receive the Best Exporter Award once again. Winning this for the fourth consecutive year is a testament to our team’s unwavering dedication, passion, and commitment to excellence. Our journey from modest beginnings to becoming a trusted international partner has been driven by innovation, integrity, and a strong export-focused vision.”

Flexiprint’s sustained success is powered by its investment in state-of-the-art flexographic printing technologies, advanced production automation, and stringent quality systems. The company uses eco-friendly water-based inks, food-grade raw materials, and environmentally conscious processes, meeting both local and international compliance requirements.

Over recent years, Flexiprint has significantly modernised its production facility with new machinery that enhances print clarity, colour accuracy, and efficiency. These advancements have greatly reduced turnaround times while maintaining exceptional product consistency — a key expectation in global markets. The company’s commitment to lean manufacturing and continuous improvement ensures that every product meets the highest benchmarks of precision, hygiene, and safety.

Flexiprint’s emphasis on world-class standards is reinforced through its internationally recognised certifications, including ISO and FSSC credentials. These certifications strengthen customer confidence and place Flexiprint among an elite group of Sri Lankan manufacturers capable of passing rigorous global audits, particularly for food-related and export-oriented packaging products.

At the core of Flexiprint’s excellence lies its dedicated workforce — a team that brings together skill, passion, and commitment. The company strongly believes that its people are its greatest asset. As such, it invests heavily in employee development, offering continuous training, leadership programmes, and technical skill-building opportunities.

Flexiprint also maintains strong emphasis on workplace safety, employee welfare, and an inclusive, collaborative work culture. This supportive environment fosters innovation and ensures long-term employee satisfaction, contributing significantly to the company’s stability and growth.

Speaking about Flexiprint’s future direction, the management stated: “This award motivates us to strive for even greater excellence. Our commitment is to expand our global footprint, advance our sustainability initiatives, and continuously elevate our capabilities to meet the evolving needs of our customers worldwide.”

Beyond industrial and export achievements, Flexiprint has always remained deeply committed to corporate social responsibility (CSR). The company actively contributes to community development, educational support, environmental conservation, and employee empowerment. Its ethical business practices reflect a long-term vision that balances profitability with positive social impact.

Flexiprint also values strong, transparent relationships with its customers, suppliers, and partners. These strong, collaborative ties form the backbone of its success, enabling the company to navigate challenges, embrace opportunities, and grow sustainably.
