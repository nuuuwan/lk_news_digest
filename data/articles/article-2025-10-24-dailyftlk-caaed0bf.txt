Researchers urged to drive agri-modernisation to cut import dependency

President Anura Kumara Disanayake presents an award at the National Awards Ceremony for Excellence in Agricultural Research

Sri Lanka’s Agriculture Minister K.D. Lalkantha yesterday said the country’s persistent reliance on imports for essential food items continues to weigh heavily on consumers and the economy. He underscored the need for evidence-based research to guide agricultural modernisation, develop value-added products, nurture young agri-entrepreneurs, and expand export-oriented farming.

Speaking at the National Awards Ceremony for Excellence in Agricultural Research for 2023 and 2025, held at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH) under the patronage of President Anura Kumara Disanayake, Lalkantha emphasised that researchers must ensure their findings are effectively conveyed to policymakers and stakeholders to enable implementation at the ground level.

He commended the Sri Lanka Council for Agricultural Research Policy (SLCARP) for its role in strengthening agricultural research and reaffirmed the Government’s commitment to a development model focused on food security, import substitution, and environmentally sustainable practices.

The biennial event, organised by SLCARP, recognises and encourages researchers contributing to the advancement of Sri Lanka’s agricultural sector. According to the President’s Media Division, the awards are designed to promote professional growth among agricultural scientists while acknowledging their role in improving national food security and innovation.

This year’s awards recognised achievements in three categories: cultivation of forest plantations, export-oriented crops, and non-crop sectors such as floriculture, livestock, fisheries, and aquatic resources, spanning the 2023 and 2025 cycles.
