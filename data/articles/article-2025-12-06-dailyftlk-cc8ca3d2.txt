UK increases SL relief funding to £ 1 m

The British High Commission yesterday announced that with UK aid already reaching Sri Lanka’s hardest-hit communities with life-saving support and early recovery, it was providing additional funding support, taking the total up to £ 1 million ($ 1.32 million).

The UK Government earlier this week provided financial support amounting to £ 675,000 ($ 890,000).
