Sectoral Oversight Committee reviews 2025 Budget progress of key ministries

The Parliamentary Sectoral Oversight Committee on Environment, Agriculture and Resource Sustainability has reviewed the financial and physical progress of the 2025 Budget proposals of several ministries, including Agriculture, Trade, Plantations, and Environment.

The Parliament Secretariat said yesterday that the discussions took place during a committee meeting held on 21 October, chaired by Member of Parliament Hector Appuhami. The review also assessed the expected progress of each ministryâ€™s budgetary commitments up to 31 December 2025.

The ministries under review were the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, Lands and Irrigation; the Ministry of Trade, Commerce, Food Security and Co-operative Development; the Ministry of Plantations and Community Infrastructure; and the Ministry of Environment.

Committee Chairman Hector Appuhami emphasised the need for a detailed report to be presented to Parliament based on the findings, outlining how funds allocated under the 2025 Budget have been utilised and the progress achieved by each ministry. He said the Committee will continue to evaluate the performance of all ministries within its purview.

The Committee examined the allocations and expenditure progress of each ministry and recommended that reports on fund utilisation and the advancement of key projects be submitted to the Committee for further review.
