Elevates local brands to APAC spotlight with three wins and 10 finalists

Roar AdX, the Meta Managed Advertising Partner and a subsidiary of Roar Global, played a central role in elevating Sri Lankan brands to regional visibility at the 2025 Meta Reels Impact Awards held recently in Singapore. This year’s event marked the first time Sri Lankan brands participated as nominees, creating new opportunities for local marketers to benchmark their work against global brands and regional standards.

Through its long-standing partnership with Meta, Roar AdX facilitated Sri Lankan campaign submissions that demonstrated strong creative performance and measurable business impact. As a result, Spa Ceylon Ayurveda and Keells Supermarkets were recognised across multiple award categories, marking a significant milestone for the Sri Lankan digital marketing industry.

Spa Ceylon Ayurveda – Best Reels for Brand and Best Reels for Community

Keells Supermarkets – Best Use of Innovation and Generative AI

In addition, 10 further entries submitted by Roar AdX on behalf of its clients including CBL, Airtel, Arienti and Bitopi (Bangladesh) were also shortlisted for the final round. This placed

Roar AdX amongst Meta managed partners with the highest number of shortlisted submissions at the event.

These recognitions underscore Roar AdX’s role in enabling local brands to compete against regional leaders by aligning creative, execution, and performance measurement with global platform standards. Roar AdX’s team of Meta Blueprint experts work closely with Meta teams across Asia Pacific, applying best practices, platform insights, and creative guidance to ensure Sri Lankan campaigns stand up to regional standards.

Roar Global CMO Umair Wolid said, “Our approach has always been to take Sri Lankan brands beyond local success and into regional relevance. We see reels emerging as a powerful advertising format in Sri Lanka with the usage growing by 80% year or year. These submissions were timely, and we are proud to have facilitated these brands in gaining regional recognition.”

By equipping local brands to compete confidently on global platforms like Meta and TikTok, Roar AdX is helping elevate Sri Lanka’s digital marketing landscape, steering it towards greater platform intelligence, AI-led creativity and global-standard performance.
