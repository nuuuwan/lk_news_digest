President Anura Kumara Dissanayake spent the weekend in Kandy, Matale, Anuradhapura, and Ratnapura, assessing Cyclone Ditwah’s impact, reviewing district-level restoration work, and meeting religious leaders to brief them on the Government’s relief program.

In Kandy, the President chaired the District Coordinating Committee and directed officials to accelerate the restoration of roads, water, and electricity, and to complete temporary repairs within the next 25 days.

He instructed that water supply be fully restored within three days and electricity by 31 December, with military support where needed. He also called for rapid compensation payments for damaged paddy and vegetable lands and emphasised coordinated action across irrigation, agriculture, and provincial agencies.

He reiterated that illegal construction would not be permitted and that a long-term plan was required to stabilise the Central Highlands.

The President visited the Malwathu and Asgiri Maha Viharayas, where he briefed the Mahanayake Theras on ongoing relief measures and received their blessings.

In Matale, the President reviewed restoration work on roads, water systems, electricity networks, and Government facilities, noting the need for accurate data to ensure compensation is issued only to eligible farmers.

With more than 11,000 people affected in the district, he instructed that drinking water supply be restored urgently, that telecommunications gaps be closed quickly, and that schools reopen by 16 December with support for students from damaged schools. He also raised the need for a structured plan to redevelop Dambulla Hospital.

On Saturday, the President travelled to Anuradhapura, directing officials to prepare the damaged paddy lands for re-cultivation ahead of the Maha season.  He told officials to submit compensation lists and required funding by Friday and instructed that a provisional water supply be arranged until irrigation systems are fully repaired.

District officials reported near-total restoration of electricity and water connections, while well-cleaning operations continued with naval assistance.  The President also reviewed housing damage and resettlement requirements and instructed that the Rs. 15,000 school allowance for affected children be fully disbursed before 31 December.

During the visit, he also met the Atamasthanadhipathi, Most Venerable Pallegama Hemarathana Nayake Thera, and briefed him on the Government’s recovery strategy.

Yesterday, in Kurunegala, the President turned to tightening enforcement and accelerating repairs.

At the District Coordination Committee, he said laws governing unauthorised construction would be strengthened and announced a dedicated legal-policy unit under the forthcoming Reconstruction Presidential Task Force.

He instructed that all damaged Provincial and Local Council roads be repaired and reopened within two weeks, with incomplete segments and funding needs reported ahead of the 2026 Budget. Kurunegala has recorded extensive infrastructure damage, including more than a thousand affected provincial roads, 35 bridges, and 162 culverts.

The President reviewed electricity, water, and communications restoration and stressed that service-providing agencies must ensure delivery “up to the end user.” He also urged local councils to take the lead in well-cleaning operations.

Officials reported that 12,729 hectares of paddy land were damaged, with 7,215 hectares still cultivable. The President instructed the Water Supply Board to provide temporary water where irrigation systems remain impaired and pressed for timely seed and fertiliser distribution. He also called for accurate data across livestock farms and directed that all livestock-related information be consolidated into a single system to support compensation and regulatory reforms.

Resettlement planning, house-damage assessments, the revival of inland fisheries, and reopening of schools were also discussed. 20 acres of temple land at the Maddeketiya, Gokarella Sangamu Raja Maha Viharaya were offered for resettlement, with documentation handed over to the President.

A financial donation of Rs. 10 million from North Western Provincial cooperative groups, along with a contribution from the Gokarella Rice Mill, was also presented.

Across all districts, the President reiterated the need for strong coordination, timely data, and rapid payments to restore livelihoods and acknowledged the work of State officials, the Police, and the Tri-Forces following Ditwah.
