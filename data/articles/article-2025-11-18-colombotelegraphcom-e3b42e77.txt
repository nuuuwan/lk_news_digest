Gahanu Eka Mittata – So Radical Without Money

The Committee Stage of the Ministry of Women & Child Affairs will be up for debate at some point. 2025 (Estimate / Appropriation Act, First Schedule) — Ministry of Women & Child Affairs: Recurrent LKR 15,234,000,000 + Capital LKR 842,000,000 → Total LKR 16,076,000,000. Parliament of Sri Lanka

* 2026 (Estimate / First Schedule) — Ministry of Women & Child Affairs: Recurrent LKR 15,800,000,000 + Capital LKR 600,000,000 → Total LKR 16,400,000,000. Parliament of Sri Lanka

The ministry totals above are part of the First Schedule (the consolidated list of ministry recurrent + capital allocations). Using the First-Schedule totals:

* Total First-Schedule government spending (2025) = Recurrent LKR 2,898,098,018,000 + Capital LKR 1,320,150,000,000 = LKR 4,218,248,018,000. Parliament of Sri Lanka

Ministry of Women (LKR 16,076,000,000) as a share of this = 0.381% (≈ 0.38%). (Calculation shown below.) Parliament of Sri Lanka

* Total First-Schedule government spending (2026) = Recurrent LKR 3,028,753,468,000 + Capital LKR 1,405,603,000,000 = LKR 4,434,356,468,000. Parliament of Sri Lanka

Ministry of Women (LKR 16,400,000,000) as a share of this = 0.370% (≈ 0.37%). Parliament of Sri Lanka

The Exact calculations: 16,076,000,000 / 4,218,248,018,000 × 100 = 0.3811%; 16,400,000,000 / 4,434,356,468,000 × 100 = 0.3698%.

The  above information was provided to me by the google search engine.  Therefore if I am wrong a humble request to the Treasury authorities and the Minister to correct me. The moral issue arises out of this glaring 0.3698% for 51% of the population. Of course not all the women in Sri Lanka are queuing in front of the Ministry with a begging bowl. But all the women in the country belonging to all categories and ages contribute immensely to the economy of this country. As workers and unpaid caregivers as those who are not employed earning a montly wage but yet maintaining a household. In a new feminist economic analysis a call has been made to include their contribution into countries financial process. I am taking women employed in all sectors to mean workers in a broader sense.

The Manifesto A Thriving Nation, A Beautiful Life  in it’s Page 43 – Gender Equality / Impartial Human Identity states thus

I quote “Although women are an integral part of society, they consistently occupy an unequal position due to marginalization within major socioeconomic, cultural, and political systems. The NPP proposes a political practice that represents all marginalized groups in society, aiming to realize the aspirations of a just society, a free country, and free women by securing all rights.

Gender identities and sexual orientations are diverse. In Sri Lanka, these groups often face violence, marginalization, and stigmatization. Outdated colonial laws, institutional frameworks, and regressive cultural beliefs contribute to the denial of justice to these communities.”

Having expressed your policy so eloquently the following principleshave been laid out; Economic justice as a cornerstone for achieving gender equality.State policies acknowledging the value of unpaid care work within the national economy. and Legislation that ensures fair and equal treatment for all marginalized groups.Further in page 5 under the title “An Empowered Woman you have promised to abolish all forms of gender discrimination, take measures,Take measures to relieve rural women from the burden of unfair microfinance loans and Initiate steps to address and end period poverty. Under social welfare schemes financial support for nutritious food supply during pregnancy and establishment of childcare centres at the Grama Niladhari (local) level have been promised

If we really summarize the pledges the NPP has promised the following:

Gender equality legal reform: NPP promises to reform discriminatory laws, create new comprehensive gender-equality legislation, and set up a strong institutional body (National Women’s Commission).

Economic empowerment: They emphasize women’s participation in the workforce, reducing barriers via childcare, financing, and training.

Social policy: NPP supports social infrastructure (e.g., childcare) to support women’s labor participation.

Child protection: They commit to community-based child safety, involving families, and systematic monitoring of child-wellbeing programs.

The agenda looks fantastic. In our review of the Beijing Platform for Action at some point governments were told that pledges they give for the advancing women’s rights should be seen in monetary values in the budget. I only have a simple question to ask from the Ministry of Women and Child Care. Can you fulfill the pledges you gave women with the allocation of 0.3698% of the budget? Obviously this is not possible. A previous gender budget analysis conducted in 2000 by UNIFEM indicated that 80% of the Ministry budget is spent on recurrent expenditure and only 20% is spent for actual welfare of women. Therefore we need to seriously ask this question how are we as a country going to implement the mechanism established to monitor the progress of the commitments the National Women’s Commission? It will rely heavily from donors. We are aware that donor funds are NOT neutral. When the Good Governance Government set up the Office on Missing Persons the late Mangala Samaraweera allocated a huge amount(I can not remember) for our operations. But due to Treasury red tapes we could not access the allocated amounts to effectively develop the mechanism. Will the same be the fate of the NWC? There is no exact allocation reflected in the budget 2026. Women’s organisations and activists who supported the NPP are excited about the establishment of the NWC though the Law was passed due to the political will of the former President Ranil Wickramasinghe. An initiative UNP regimes launched several years ago scuttled by the SLFP opposition and finally even during a bad economic context passed in parliament. I am not sure whether the NPP voted in favour.

In this document, while there are many policy areas, the gender-specific and children-specific commitments are not in a standalone “women & children” chapter; they are integrated under social policy / human rights / welfare.

* Title: National People’s Party (sic) Policy Framework – English (longer policy booklet) Global Sri Lankan Congress

* This is more detailed and includes sections specifically on gender equality, women’s rights, and children.

This is an analytical / interpretive document by a third party, not exactly the manifesto, but useful for understanding how NPP’s policies on gender / children map onto broader discourse.

Here are some of the relevant excerpts from the Policy Framework (from National People’s Party Policy Framework – English):

If you like, I can send you a link to download the exact English PDF of their manifesto that includes all gender-and-children-specific sections (or extract that as a plain-text “women & children manifesto” section). Do you want me to do that?

Good question. Here is a link to the English version of the National People’s Power (NPP) manifesto / policy document:

If you like, I can extract and send just the “Women & Children” section (as text). Do you want me to do that?
