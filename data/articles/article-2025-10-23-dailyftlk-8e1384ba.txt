Police to receive CID’s report on Piumi’s connection to ‘Kehelbaddara Padme’

Says she earns not from drugs or black money from underworld

Police Spokesman Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) F.U. Wootler said Police are yet to receive a report from the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) regarding actress Piumi Hansamali’s alleged involvement with the arrested underworld figure known as ‘Kehelbaddara Padme’.

“We have not received any official report from the CID, which is investigating the matter,” he said.

Meanwhile, Hansamali, denying any connection with Padme, has said that she had only seen him in Dubai during New Year celebrations in March 2022.

“I met this person with his wife and children at the event and they took a photo with me. There, he said he wanted to become fair. I told him to use my Piumi Skin products. I think he has used the product and that is why he looks attractive,” she has written on her Facebook account.

Hansamali said that the CID officials questioned her whether she had any financial dealings with Padme, but she dismissed any links with him.

“I never ever had any monetary transactions with him. I do not want to have money earned from drugs, illegal money, or any black money. I am an iron woman, who stood on my own feet independently through promoting my business – Piumi Skin Private Limited,” she wrote.

Hansamali said that she had no connection to the underworld as she was scared to die of a gunshot.

“I am deadly scared. Promise,” she said, inviting those who want to become fair and beautiful to buy her skincare products. (SS)
