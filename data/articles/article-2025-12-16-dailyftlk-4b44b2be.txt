Countdown to FACETS 2026 begins

Sri Lanka is gearing up to host the first international gem and jewellery exhibition of the year as FACETS Sri Lanka 2026 opens on 3 January. Now in its 33rd year, the exhibition marks a major milestone with its move to The Forum, Cinnamon Life at City of Dreams, creating the most expansive edition of FACETS to date.

Spread across two floors, this year’s exhibition promises an elevated and immersive experience for buyers, traders, collectors and jewellery enthusiasts from around the world. The modern facilities of Cinnamon Life combined with redesigned exhibition spaces bring a new energy to the iconic showcase of Sri Lanka’s gemstone heritage.

A landmark highlight this year is the presence of the globally renowned Gübelin Gem Lab as the Official Gem Lab Partner. With more than a century of expertise, Gübelin is one of the industry’s most respected institutions. Its first-ever participation in a Sri Lankan gem exhibition offers exhibitors and visitors access to world-class gem testing and certification during the event.

FACETS 2026 is supported by a strong line-up of partners, including Cinnamon Life as Hotel and Venue Partner, Akbar Brothers and Barista as Tea and Coffee Lounge Partners, John Keells Properties as Real Estate Partner, Alpha Industries as Safe Partner, Universal Travel Bureau (UTB) as Travel Partner, Brinks as Official Security Partner, and LMD as Official Business Magazine.

In addition, 11 leading exporters and jewellers have joined the Sapphire Sponsorship Circle, underscoring the industry’s unified commitment to expanding the reach of Ceylon sapphires on the global stage.

This year introduces a new Virtual Reality Gem Mine Experience, offering visitors an opportunity to explore Sri Lanka’s gem-mining heritage through immersive storytelling. The Export Development Board (EDB) Pavilion and National Gem and Jewellery Authority (NGJA) Pavilion will also highlight the small and medium enterprise (SME) sector, showcasing emerging jewellers, lapidarists, and gemstone traders alongside established industry leaders.

FACETS 2026 is organised by the Sri Lanka Gem and Jewellery Association (SLGJA), and endorsed by the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority, the NGJA, the EDB, and supported by the International Coloured Stone Association.

SLGJA President Akram Cassim stated that FACETS 2026 represents an important step forward for the industry as it shifts to a larger venue and introduces new global partnerships. “This edition elevates the presence of Sri Lankan gemstones and reflects the brilliance and innovation of our industry,” he said.

FACETS Chairman Armil Sammoon noted that the exhibition enters a new era in 2026. “With a world-class venue and the arrival of Gübelin Gem Lab, we are enhancing every touchpoint of the visitor experience. FACETS 2026 will be bigger, bolder, and truly world-class,” he added.

FACETS Sri Lanka will run from 3-5 January 2026 at The Forum, Cinnamon Life at City of Dreams. With a modern venue, global collaborations and an expanded program, this edition aims to redefine how Sri Lanka presents its gemstone legacy to the world.
