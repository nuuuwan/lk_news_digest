Solo traveller Molly praises Sri Lanka’s response after harassment incident goes viral

Molly, a traveller from Christchurch, New Zealand, has issued a detailed follow-up after her video documenting harassment during a solo trip to Sri Lanka went viral globally, sparking widespread debate, media attention, and an unexpected wave of victim-blaming.

In a new video message shared online, Molly said she “didn’t expect it to blow up the way it did,” noting that the original clip was viewed millions of times and circulated across multiple platforms. The sudden visibility, she said, brought not only support, but also disturbing reactions including comments suggesting she was responsible for the incident simply because she travelled alone.

“Women should be able to solo travel. We are not the problem,” she said. “There are men who don’t know how to behave correctly. My personal favourite was that I should travel with a man to protect myself from men.”

She said some of the harshest criticism came from other women, who questioned her “survival skills” and suggested solo travel was inherently unsafe. The global media picked up the story, triggering a broader conversation on safety for female travellers—an important but, she said, frustratingly reactive debate. Viral moments, she reminded followers, typically highlight “the bad things,” which can distort public perception and make isolated incidents appear more widespread than they are.

Molly emphasised that the harassment she experienced should not be taken as representative of Sri Lanka or of solo female travel. “I’ve travelled through so many countries people label as ‘unsafe,’ and all I’ve experienced is kindness from locals,” she said. “This incident can happen anywhere in the world, including your hometown, because unfortunately, men like this exist everywhere.”

She also went out of her way to defend Sri Lanka, describing the country as “amazing” and one she would “always recommend to other people, especially solo female travellers.” Her own experience, she stressed, was overwhelmingly positive. “I experienced nothing but kindness, generosity, and welcoming behaviour from locals. Whenever I had a problem, they were always there to help me.”

Following the viral video, Sri Lankan media widely circulated the footage, prompting authorities to act. Molly said she contacted the Sri Lankan Police, who responded “immediately,” launching an investigation and manhunt. “I can’t thank the Sri Lankan Police enough,” she said. “Their response was incredible, and within four days, he had been located and arrested.”

The suspect is now before Court, and Police have assured her they will continue to update her on the case.

While acknowledging her ordeal could have ended far worse and that many women globally have faced more dangerous situations, Molly said she is glad the conversation is expanding.

“This is the reality women around the world face every single day,” she noted, adding that raising awareness is crucial to addressing the behaviour that places women at risk, no matter the country.

Despite the trauma and chaotic aftermath, her message ends on a note of clarity: the man responsible does not represent Sri Lanka, and one incident should not overshadow the warmth she experienced throughout her travels.
