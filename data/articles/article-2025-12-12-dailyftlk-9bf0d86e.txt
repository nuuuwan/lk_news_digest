Lanka Thriposha hands over Rs. 100 m dividend to Treasury

Lanka Thriposha Ltd., on Wednesday paid Rs. 100 million in dividends to the General Treasury, reinforcing the State-owned nutrition provider’s financial contribution despite recent speculation about its future.

The cheque was officially handed over to Finance and Planning Deputy Minister Dr. Anil Jayantha Fernando by Thriposha Chairman Amal Attanayake and senior company officials. Trade, Commerce, Food Security and Cooperative Development Minister Wasantha Samarasinghe was also present at the occasion.

Dr. Fernando dismissed rumours circulating in recent weeks claiming that the Thriposha company was facing closure.

He said the enterprise is operating sustainably under the current administration. “Thriposha will continue to provide a safe and reliable service due to the proper management of the Government and the dedication of its employees,” the Deputy Minister assured.

Thriposha, a key provider of fortified food supplements to mothers and children, remains one of the country’s most important public nutrition initiatives.
