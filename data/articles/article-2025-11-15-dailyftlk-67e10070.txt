Cabinet approves five-year strategic plan to strengthen Vidatha program countrywide

Aims to empower rural communities via scientific and technology innovation

The Cabinet of Ministers on Monday approved a five-year strategic plan (2026–2030) for the Vidatha program, aimed at empowering rural communities through technology developed via scientific research. The program, initiated under the concept of “Technology for Villages,” currently operates 315 Vidatha Centres island-wide.

The Science and Technology Ministry has prepared the plan to reinforce the Vidatha initiative, addressing the limited attention it received during 2021–2024. As part of the strategy, efforts are underway to transform Vidatha Resource Centres into microservices, in collaboration with institutions including the National Enterprise Development Authority (NEDA) and the Industrial Development Board of Sri Lanka (IDB).

Under the approved plan, each of the 315 Vidatha Centres will engage a dedicated science graduate to strengthen local technology access and support rural innovation, marking a significant step toward enhancing scientific literacy and technological empowerment in village communities across the country.
