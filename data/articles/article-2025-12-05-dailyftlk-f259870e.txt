Namal pledges salary, allowances to assist children

MP Namal Rajapaksa has said he will contribute his monthly salary and allowances to “Adaraya,” a program he launched to support children from families affected by the recent floods and landslides.  The initiative, introduced last week, focuses on providing essential school supplies, including books, pens, and pencils, to help children return to their studies despite the disruption.

Rajapaksa said the program is open to anyone who wants to assist children in the affected areas. The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) estimates that nearly 300,000 children have been impacted by the disaster, with more than 275,000 affected by Cyclone Ditwah.
