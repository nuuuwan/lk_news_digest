Apparel sector activates industry-wide relief, recovery effort

The Joint Apparel Association Forum (JAAF) has announced that the industry has activated a coordinated response to safeguard communities affected by the severe weather conditions across Sri Lanka.

With reports of flooding, landslides and access disruptions in several districts, JAAF confirmed that employee safety and wellbeing remain the sector’s highest priority.

JAAF is working closely with all member organisations to identify affected employees, assess immediate needs, and ensure timely assistance. Most factories across the country have resumed normal operations, with only a few isolated pockets still facing access and other infrastructure-related challenges. Across the country, companies are already providing emergency support, including food, clothing, temporary shelter, transport assistance, and other essential supplies for displaced workers, their families and the local community.

To streamline relief coordination, JAAF has established focal points for member companies to report affected communities and to share district-level impact updates. This mechanism allows faster mobilisation of resources and ensures no employee or family is overlooked.

JAAF is also in active communication with Government authorities, providing real-time information on affected employees and supporting national relief efforts in regions where access remains difficult.

The Association notes “Our industry’s resilience comes from our people. We are committed to standing with every employee affected by this disaster, and we are working with our members and the Government to ensure immediate recovery and long-term support.”
