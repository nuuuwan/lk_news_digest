Ragama Rehabilitation Hospital, Science and Technology  Ministry to collaborate on advanced medical innovation

The Ragama Rheumatology and Rehabilitation Hospital, the country’s foremost institution dedicated to the treatment of patients with physical disabilities is set to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Science and Technology Ministry to enhance its technological capabilities and patient care systems.

The initiative follows a recent inspection visit to the hospital by Science and Technology Minister Prof. Chrishantha Abeysena, who also chairs the Gampaha District Health Committee. During a subsequent meeting held at the Ministry, it was agreed that the Ministry would extend technical support and consultancy services to modernise the hospital’s medical equipment, machinery and assistive technology. A team of experts from the Ministry’s affiliated institutions carried out a detailed evaluation of the hospital’s ongoing activities; including organ replacement design, industrial equipment manufacturing, and the work of the Prosthetic and Orthotic Training School. Based on this assessment, the Ministry, through the National Engineering Research and Development Centre (NERDC) and the Arthur C. Clarke Institute for Modern Technologies, in collaboration with the University of Kelaniya’s Faculty of Technology and the Ragama Rehabilitation Hospital, will establish a comprehensive technological partnership.

The collaboration aims to modernise medical equipment through advanced engineering methods, introduce high-quality materials, upgrade production systems, and provide technical training and capacity development for hospital staff. It will also include setting up a joint research and development (R&D) unit to foster innovation.

Among the expected outcomes are enhanced production efficiency, local manufacturing of affordable prosthetic limbs, wheelchairs, and assistive devices, reduced dependency on imports, and the creation of a skilled, innovation-driven hospital workforce. The partnership also aims to strengthen long-term collaboration between Sri Lanka’s healthcare and engineering sectors.

An action plan outlining the initiative will be prepared jointly and submitted for Cabinet approval before the formal signing of the MoU.

Minister Prof. Abeysena emphasised that the core objective of the project is to improve the quality of life for patients through technological advancement, noting that the establishment of a dedicated Medical Research Centre under the Ministry’s leadership will play a central role in achieving these goals. The discussion was attended by Science and Technology Ministry Secretary Mohamed Navavi, Rheumatology and Rehabilitation Hospital Director Dr. Chandragupta Ranasinghe, Arthur C. Clarke Institute Chairman Prof. Chandana Jayaratne, NERD Centre Director-General Dr. Jayathu Samarawickrama, and other senior officials.
