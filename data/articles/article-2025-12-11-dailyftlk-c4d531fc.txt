Work in Sri Lanka to unite global talent and local industry leaders

Work in Sri Lanka (WISL), a volunteer-driven non-profit dedicated to supporting diaspora returnees, will host its flagship Work in Sri Lanka Conference on 17 December at Cinnamon Life, bringing together high-level Government advisers, industry leaders, recent returnees, and globally experienced Sri Lankans exploring a potential move back home.

Since re-launching its activities this year, WISL has hosted three successful networking events attended by more than 150 recent and prospective returnees representing the UK, US, Middle East, Europe, Singapore, and Australia.

These gatherings have sparked meaningful dialogue between global talent and the local business community and have strengthened a unique network of senior professionals, founders, and policymakers committed to supporting Sri Lanka’s “brain gain” efforts.

The upcoming conference builds on this momentum by bringing both sides of this network, diaspora talent and Sri Lankan industry leadership, into one room to exchange insights, assess opportunities, and explore pathways for return, investment, and long-term contribution.

The conference will feature two key panels and a Fireside Conversation.

The Fireside Conversation, which will focus on the topic “Economic Outlook and Stability,” will feature Chief Presidential Adviser on Digital Economy Dr. Hans Wijayasuriya, LYNEAR Wealth Management Chairman and former Central Bank of Sri Lanka Governor Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy, and LYNEAR Wealth Management Managing Director and Co-Founder Dr. Naveen Gunawardane.

The Industry Panel will focus on “Key Sectors Driving Sri Lanka Forward,” and will feature WSO2 Founder, CEO and Director Dr. Sanjiva Weerawarana, Magellan Champlain Founder and CEO Sarrah Sammoon, TWC Holdings Founder, Chairman and Managing Director Thilan Wijesinghe, and Nations Trust Bank CEO Hemantha Gunetilleke.

The Returnee Panel will be centre on “Lessons from Recent Returnees,” and will feature Uber Country Manager Varun Wijewardane, Acuity Knowledge Partners Associate Director Niluki Arsacularatne, and OCTAVE – John Keells Group Chief Scientist Sadeep Jayasumana.

WISL Co-Founder Nayana Samaranayake said: “Many Sri Lankans abroad are open to the idea of returning, investing, or contributing — but they often don’t know where to start. What they need first is clarity, honest information, and a genuine connection to people on the ground who understand the realities. Our goal is to create a space where they can access insights without conditions, meet others who have made the journey home, and feel supported in making an informed and confident decision about Sri Lanka.”

The conference will be held on 17 December from 6 p.m. onwards at Cinnamon Life, Colombo.
