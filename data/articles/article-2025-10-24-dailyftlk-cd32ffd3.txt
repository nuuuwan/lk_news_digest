Renowned academic and humanitarian Dr. Dulan Hettiarachchi was recently honoured with the “Pride of Nation” international award at a special ceremony held at the BMICH, Colombo, organised by the Asian Academic Forum.

This distinguished recognition was presented in appreciation of Dr. Hettiarachchi’s remarkable humanitarian initiative, the “One Coffee Campaign”, through which 184 houses were built and donated to differently-abled families across Sri Lanka.

Dr. Hettiarachchi, who has earned international recognition from countries such as Australia, China, India, the United Kingdom, and Kuwait, holds a Doctorate in International Relations and has served as a diplomat in both Australia and China, making notable contributions to global cooperation and cultural understanding.

He currently serves as a lecturer at several leading universities, including the University of Colombo (Sri Lanka), GKU University (India), and LBU University (Nepal).

In addition to his academic and diplomatic engagements, Dr. Hettiarachchi is the Chairman of the Tourism and Cultural Task Force, where he plays a key role in promoting Sri Lanka’s heritage, culture, and sustainable tourism.

As an environmental activist, Dr. Hettiarachchi has been instrumental in initiatives such as declaring the Galle Kottawa Forest Reserve a protected area and in campaigns to reduce noise pollution from vehicles and industries. In recognition of his environmental service, he was also honoured with the Presidential Environmental Award in 2018.

The “Pride of Nation” award stands as a testament to Dr. Dulan Hettiarachchi’s exceptional leadership, intellectual contribution, and humanitarian commitment—both within Sri Lanka and on the international stage.
