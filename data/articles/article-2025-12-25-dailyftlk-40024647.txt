16th Jaffna International Trade Fair returns in January 2026

The Jaffna International Trade Fair (JITF), Northern Sri Lanka’s largest and most influential multitrade exhibition, will return for its 16th consecutive year from 23 to 25 January 2026 at the Muttraweli Ground in Jaffna. As the region’s most established commercial platform, the fair continues to play a central role in advancing economic betterment, fostering business connectivity, and promoting technology-driven innovation across the Northern Province. Organised by Lanka Exhibition & Conference Services (LECS)—Sri Lanka’s leading exhibition and trade-show organiser and Presidential Award Winner in association with the Chamber of Commerce & Industries of Yarlpanam (CCIY)—JITF has grown into one of the country’s most anticipated annual events. LECS, known for its professionalism and decades-long industry expertise, ensures that JITF offers top-tier participation, wide national visibility, and a steady promotional reach throughout the Jaffna Peninsula. Its strong network and reputation continue to draw businesses, investors, and institutions that recognise the fair as a strategic gateway to the rapidly developing Northern market.

Over the years, JITF has firmly established itself as the North’s most comprehensive and results-driven trade exhibition. The 2026 edition reaffirms this standing. Last year, the event welcomed 78,452 visitors from across Sri Lanka and 5,000 invited business delegates, including senior officials, corporate leaders, entrepreneurs, and investors. This impressive turnout reflects the fair’s status as a premier venue for commercial exchange and market exploration. The exhibition will feature 400+ stalls presenting an extensive range of products, services, and advanced technologies across multiple industries. Its diverse exhibitor base attracts manufacturers, service providers, distributors, importers, exporters, and innovators seeking exposure to one of Sri Lanka’s most promising and steadily expanding regional economies. A key strength of the fair is its ability to foster meaningful business conversations—nearly 70% of visitors engage in direct business discussions, resulting in new partnerships, distribution agreements, and investment opportunities. Exhibitors consistently identify JITF as a catalyst for market expansion, brand visibility, and long-term business development. To support maximum participation and engagement, the 2026 edition has been strategically scheduled to avoid regional holidays, ensuring that both exhibitors and visitors can take part without competing commitments. This planning approach continues to strengthen JITF’s influence as a marketplace where business activity thrives.

JITF’s strength lies in its wide-ranging sector representation, making it a central hub for innovation, trade, and commercial growth. The 2026 exhibition will feature an array of industries, including: Construction materials and machinery, Automobile, Consumer Products, Agriculture, Hotel Supplies, Apparel and machinery, Food, Beverage and Packaging, ICT, Financial Services, Education, Healthcare Products and Services, Emerging and specialised industries. This broad coverage ensures that the fair caters to both B2B and B2C audiences, attracting an impressive cross-section of stakeholders from multiple sectors. The exhibition provides an ideal environment for product launches, market testing, business matchmaking, and networking with key decision-makers.

Each year, the Jaffna International Trade Fair draws a varied and influential audience whose participation contributes significantly to the region’s economic activity. Typical visitors include:

This vibrant mix of stakeholders makes the fair a natural hub for forging long-term business collaborations and stimulating trade development in the North.

The Jaffna International Trade Fair has become a cornerstone of post-conflict economic revival in the Northern Province. As infrastructure strengthens and investment flows steadily into the region, JITF continues to serve as a gateway for businesses exploring new opportunities in a dynamic and rapidly evolving market. With its high visitor turnout, wide sector representation, sustainability initiatives, and educational platforms, the 16th Jaffna International Trade Fair 2026 reinforces its position as Northern Sri Lanka’s most significant hub for trade, innovation, and sustainable development. In alignment with global sustainability trends, JITF will continue its Plastic Neutral Initiative for the second consecutive year in 2026. The initiative reflects the organisers’ commitment to environmental responsibility and their efforts to minimise the ecological footprint of large-scale events.

Special waste management and recycling stations will be placed throughout the exhibition grounds to encourage proper disposal of plastic and polythene waste. Visitors will have opportunities to participate in engaging and educational activities designed to build awareness about sustainable waste management and recycling practices. The fair also encourages the public to bring plastic waste from home, directly supporting regional recycling efforts.

All collected plastic will be responsibly recycled or upcycled in partnership with approved waste-management organisations. Through this initiative, JITF not only reduces waste generated during the event but also contributes to creating a cleaner, greener, and more environmentally conscious future for the Northern Province.
