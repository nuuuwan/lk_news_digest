Sri Lanka’s topography dictates global tea prices

A leading tea industry expert says that Sri Lanka’s internationally famed tea business operates on a clear three-tier system, where the altitude at which leaves are grown directly dictates their market role and price.

“Looking at the sales data of Forbes & Walker, elevation isn’t just about geography – it’s about economics,” the expert says. “Each tier – high, medium, and low-grown – has a completely different function in the global market.”

At the top are the high-grown teas from misty regions like Nuwara Eliya. “This is the luxury tier,” the expert notes. “The slow growth in cool air creates exquisite flavour and aroma, fetching top dollar at auction. It’s our prestige export, but it’s fragile being dependent on perfect weather and global demand trends,” he says.

“The medium-grown teas, mainly from areas like Kandy, are the industry’s reliable core. These teas are the versatile workhorses,” the expert explains. They offer good character at a more accessible price and are essential for creating consistent blends. Their strength is stable demand while they’re always working to be valued on their own, not just as a blending ingredient.”

“In the coastal plains, low-grown teas are all about scale. This is the volume engine,” the expert describes. These teas are stronger and yield more. They’re built for mass markets in places like the Middle East and Russia, competing on price and volume with other robust teas. Success here is measured in tonnes shipped.”

The expert warns that all three tires – not only high-grown teas, now face threats from climate change . The path forward is equal focus on all three tiers.

“Sri Lanka’s unique advantage isn’t just one type of tea given the emerging challenges. We need to produce the full spectrum, from the most delicate to the strongest. By marketing this complete range as our strength, we can secure a position no other country can easily match. I’d say that Sri Lanka tea sales data regularly presented by Forbes & Walker is a map, showing that the true strength of our international tea market lies in the synergy of all three heights,” he says.
