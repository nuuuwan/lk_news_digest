Govt. urges Constitutional Council to act on Auditor General appointment

Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa says Constitutional Council to either approve one of the nominees or clearly explain why proposed names were being rejected

Asserts Constitutional Council has an ‘unavoidable duty’ to facilitate decisions that move the country forward

Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa yesterday pressed the Constitutional Council to move swiftly on appointing a new Auditor General, warning that continued delays were undermining confidence in key State institutions and risking systemic damage to public finance oversight.

Speaking at the post-Cabinet media briefing, he said the Government was keen to see a permanent Auditor General appointed without further delay, noting that President Anura Kumara Dissanayake had already proposed four suitably qualified candidates for the post.

He stressed that it was now incumbent on the Constitutional Council to either approve one of the nominees or clearly explain why the proposed names were being rejected.

“If the President has forwarded qualified individuals and they are being turned down, the reasons must be communicated transparently,” Dr. Jayatissa said, cautioning that arbitrary rejection of candidates was creating mistrust and contributing to the weakening of an essential oversight function.

The Cabinet Spokesman’s comments follow concerns raised by the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL), which has written to the President highlighting the prolonged failure to appoint a permanent Auditor General since April 2025. The BASL has warned that the vacancy poses risks to governance, transparency and the rule of law.

Dr. Jayatissa asserted that while the President and Cabinet carry responsibility for governing the country, the Constitutional Council also has an ‘unavoidable duty’ to facilitate decisions that move the country forward.

He warned against what he described as the misuse of authority or privilege to block appointments, saying such actions were inappropriate at a time when Sri Lanka needed strong institutions to combat corruption and ensure accountability.

“The Council should act responsibly and assist in maintaining the integrity of the State machinery rather than contributing to institutional paralysis,” he said.

Responding to questions on why the Acting Auditor General had not been nominated for the permanent post, Dr. Jayatissa rejected the notion that seniority alone should determine the appointment.

He argued that waiting for a preferred candidate or holding back decisions until a particular individual’s name emerged was neither democratic nor consistent with sound constitutional practice.

According to him, the President had made his nominations based on experience, information available and proven track records, and it would be unfair if those choices were blocked to advance personal preferences within the Council.

Dr. Jayatissa said the Government expected the Constitutional Council to rise to the occasion and provide the necessary cooperation to ensure continuity in the public administration system, adding that eliminating fraudulent practices and strengthening accountability required decisive and timely action on key institutional appointments.
