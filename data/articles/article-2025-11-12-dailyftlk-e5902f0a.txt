UNESCO adopts Sri Lanka-led resolution to observe International Day of Vesak annually

UNESCO has formally adopted a resolution proposed by Sri Lanka to commemorate the International Day of Vesak each year. The resolution, numbered 43 C/22, was endorsed at the 43rd General Conference held in Samarkand on 6 November 2025, the Foreign Affairs Ministry said.

The initiative follows the Executive Board’s 2024 decision (219 EX/27), which called on the Director-General to forward the proposal to the General Conference for formal approval. Both the 2025 resolution and the earlier decision draw on the United Nations General Assembly Resolution 54/115 of 1999, which granted international recognition to Vesak.

Under the new UNESCO resolution, the Director-General is requested to issue an annual message marking Vesak and to arrange commemorations each May at UNESCO Headquarters in coordination with interested member States. The resolution highlights the continuing relevance of Buddhist values and their contribution to peace, health, and well-being in modern society.

Speaking after the adoption, Sri Lanka’s Ambassador and Permanent Delegate to UNESCO, Manisha Gunasekera, welcomed the decision and noted that Vesak embodies peace, inter-cultural dialogue, and shared humanity, principles central to UNESCO’s mission. She also underscored the resolution’s alignment with UNESCO’s Major Programmes III and IV, as well as with Sustainable Development Goal 16 on fostering peaceful and inclusive societies.

Gunasekera expressed appreciation to member states, the Director-General, and UNESCO officials for their cooperation and support. The 2024 Executive Board proposal was co-authored by Sri Lanka and several Asian countries, Bhutan, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Mongolia, Myanmar, Nepal, and Thailand, and gained broad backing across all regions, including India.

Representatives from India, Vietnam, and Bangladesh also spoke at the General Conference, welcoming the resolution’s adoption.
