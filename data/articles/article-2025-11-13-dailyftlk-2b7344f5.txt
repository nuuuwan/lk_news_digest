PickMe ‘Nena Pahana’ brings human connection  to digital platform economy

In an age where algorithms connect riders and drivers in milliseconds, PickMe is taking a step back to reintroduce something distinctly human — belonging. Through its annual Nena Pahana initiative, the digital mobility platform is shining a light on the people engaged on the platform, the drivers, and more importantly, their families.

On 5 November, PickMe hosted its ninth consecutive ‘Nena Pahana’ event at Water’s Edge, Battaramulla. What began in 2018 as a small gesture of gratitude has grown into one of the most meaningful annual events in Sri Lanka’s platform economy: a celebration of the educational achievements of drivers’ children and a reminder that technology can be a bridge for empathy, not just efficiency.

Unlike traditional employment structures, PickMe drivers are independent micro-entrepreneurs, free to choose when and how they work. But with independence often comes isolation. Recognising this, PickMe has been intentional in creating initiatives that restore the sense of belonging typically found in workplaces.

PickMe Chief Executive Officer Jiffry Zulfer said: “Drivers engaged on our platform don’t clock in or out, and there’s no employer-employee relationship. But they are the lifeblood of our platform. Nena Pahana helps remind them, and us, that they are part of a larger family, united by shared purpose and pride.”

This year, the company supported more than 650 school-going children by offering vouchers for school supplies. A new highlight in 2025 was the donation of laptops to ten students who topped their G.C.E. A/L exams and secured university admission; a symbolic gesture linking digital empowerment to educational advancement.

To date, PickMe has invested over Rs. 29 million in Nena Pahana, with Rs. 9 million allocated for this year alone. More than 4,800 students have benefited from the initiative since its inception. The selection process is designed to reward both driver excellence and family achievement, with eligibility tied to Gold and Platinum tier drivers in PickMe’s Loyalty Ranking system who are also part of the platform’s insurance scheme.

Children who pass the Grade 5 Scholarship exam, obtain nine A’s at the O/Ls, or enter university receive financial support, reinforcing a culture of accountability and reward across generations.

For PickMe, the Nena Pahana initiative is part of a comprehensive support and recognition programme for its independent driver-partners. The company also facilitates a Rs. 3 million personal accident insurance cover in partnership with Co-Operative Insurance Company PLC, which includes critical illness, hospitalisation, disability, and funeral benefits.

These programmes reinforce PickMe’s belief that a digital economy must still care for the people who make it run. In celebrating not just performance but family achievement, PickMe is redefining what loyalty and connection mean in the platform age.

As the company continues to scale across Sri Lanka’s mobility and logistics sectors, Nena Pahana stands as a quiet reminder that behind every ride request and delivery ping, there is a person, and a family, whose dreams deserve to be celebrated. For the thousands of drivers who open the PickMe app each day, the initiative serves as more than just an incentive—it’s a reminder that even in the gig economy, community still matters.
