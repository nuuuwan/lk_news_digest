PM thanks diplomatic community for swift response, flags ongoing post-flood challenges

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Foreign Employment and Tourism yesterday hosted a special briefing for Sri Lanka’s diplomatic community, chaired by Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya alongside Minister Vijitha Herath.

Senior officials from the Disaster Management Centre and the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority joined the session.

According to the Prime Minister’s office, Dr. Amarasuriya opened the briefing by thanking foreign missions for the assistance extended in the immediate aftermath of the floods and landslides. She said the country had faced one of its most serious disasters in recent years, but rapid coordination among government agencies had helped stabilise the situation and accelerate relief efforts.

The Prime Minister noted that no tourist casualties had been reported and that areas previously cut off are now accessible. Large-scale clean-up and decontamination work is in progress to make public spaces safe, while communication services have been restored in affected regions.

She said relief and evacuation work had relied on the combined efforts of the armed forces, police, health services, public officials, volunteers and local authorities.

Dr. Amarasuriya also pointed to the challenges ahead, including damaged infrastructure, the need for resettlement, and longer-term disaster-mitigation measures. She welcomed the technical, humanitarian and financial support pledged by partner governments as recovery work continues.
