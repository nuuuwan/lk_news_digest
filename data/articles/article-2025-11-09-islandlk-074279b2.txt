Levi & Dili: Styling Sri Lanka’s new generation of fearless women

In a fashion landscape often crowded with ‘me too’ products, a new Sri Lankan label is making a statement that is as much about identity as it is about aesthetics. Levi & Dili, the creation of Founder and CEO Ganga Wijayawardane, is emerging as a powerful platform for the modern woman, championing a philosophy where style meets substance.

With a formidable background in International Marketing, Wijayawardane is now channeling her corporate expertise into her lifelong passion for design. The result is a fashion line with an international-contemporary feel, characterised by clean silhouettes, unusual fabric combinations, and curated, hand-picked accessories. But what truly sets Levi & Dili apart is its soul.

“The Levi & Dili woman stands for all women who long to be more, do more, to move beyond traditional roles,” Wijayawardane states. The brand’s designs are intentionally bold and eye-catching, crafted to reflect the multifaceted personality of its wearer. She is envisioned as an entrepreneur, a boss lady, a creative force, a resilient mother – a real woman who is “fearless, focused, and free.” This triad is not just a tagline but the brand’s core design brief, reflected in visuals that showcase capability and agency.

This ambition is matched by a steadfast commitment to quality. The label adheres to rigorous standards through small, controlled production batches, vetting suppliers, and conducting thorough fabric and wear tests. This promise of “affordable luxury” is a key pillar, offering fewer, better pieces with durable materials and considered details that flatter multiple body types. “We spend where it matters – fit, finishing and materials – and edit out anything that adds cost without value,” she explains.

Customer experience remains deeply personal, a non-negotiable for the brand. Online, real stylists are available for consultations, ensuring a high-touch service that continues post-purchase. While currently operating through e-commerce and pop-ups across Colombo, strategic plans are underway for a dedicated design studio, a stepping stone to a future flagship store.

Looking ahead, Wijayawardane’s vision is expansive. Within five years, she sees Levi & Dili as a leading Fashion House, setting the tone for Sri Lankan fashion and moving internationally. The goal is to be a Maison renowned not just for its designs and quality finishes, but for its key message: empowering a new generation of financially independent women who live fully and contribute significantly to the economy.

Levi & Dili is more than clothing; it is a wearable testament to the ambitious, modern Sri Lankan woman.
