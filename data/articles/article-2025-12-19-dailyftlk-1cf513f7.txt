In a significant step towards advancing Sri Lanka, Dialog Axiata PLC has announced the commercial launch of Dialog 5G Ultra, marking a major milestone in the country’s digital evolution and its transition into the 5G era. Dialog’s 5G network is powered by over 220 live 5G sites serving over 1.5 million subscribers and leads the country as the first to commercially enable 5G in Sri Lanka—underscoring its leadership in advancing next-generation connectivity nationwide.

The commercial launch follows Dialog securing a 100 MHz block in the 3500 MHz band and a 200 MHz block in the 27 GHz band at the 5G spectrum auction conducted by the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka (TRCSL).

Dialog 5G Ultra delivers advanced 5G connectivity with ultra-fast speeds, low latency, and enhanced network performance, laying the foundation for richer digital experiences for consumers in Sri Lanka, alongside advanced capabilities across enterprises and industries. By leveraging both 3500 MHz spectrum for wide-area mobile coverage and 27 GHz spectrum for high-capacity, gigabit-speed use cases, Dialog is uniquely positioned to support future-ready consumer and enterprise applications.

Dialog Axiata Group Chief Executive Officer Supun Weerasinghe said, “The launch of Dialog 5G Ultra represents a defining step in strengthening Sri Lanka’s digital infrastructure for the future. Beyond faster connectivity, 5G is a critical enabler of innovation, productivity, and inclusion across the digital economy. As Sri Lanka’s largest 5G network, we are committed to investing $ 100 million over the next two years to expand 5G connectivity across the country and ensure that individuals, businesses, and industries can fully participate in a digital Sri Lanka. We are thankful to the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka and the Government of Sri Lanka for conducting a transparent auction process to allocate 5G spectrum.”

Dialog’s 5G journey builds on a strong legacy of innovation — from being the first to introduce 2G,3G and 4G in South Asia, to pioneering early 5G demonstrations, and operating the country’s most extensive 5G trial network over several years. The commercial launch of Dialog 5G Ultra now brings these advancements into widespread use, embedding high-performance connectivity into everyday life and business.

To mark the launch, Dialog has introduced a range of 5G-related offers across devices, data plans and content, enabling customers to experience the full potential of 5G across mobile and entertainment. For more information, please visit www.dialog.lk
