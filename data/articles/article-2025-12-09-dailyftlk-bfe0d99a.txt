EDB launches fast-track relief to support exporters affected by adverse weather

The Export Development Board (EDB) has launched a rapid relief and recovery program following the severe impact of adverse weather conditions on Sri Lanka’s export sector. A discussion meeting was held recently at the EDB premises, with the participation of Secretary to the Ministry of Industry and Entrepreneurship Development Tilaka Jayasundara, EDB Chairman and CEO Mangala Wijesinghe, Acting Director General Erandika Dissanayake, Acting Additional Director General Kumudinie Mudalige, Trade Facilitation and Trade Information Director Dr. Sanjeewa Rathnasekara along with senior officials and exporters.

The EDB has already commenced comprehensive damage assessments of exporters most affected by the adverse weather conditions. These assessments will guide the targeted relief interventions required for the export sector.

EDB Chairman emphasised that strategic interventions are actively underway to tackle immediate challenges facing the export sector. These measures focus on minimising disruptions to export operations to ensure a steady flow of goods and services to international markets. Additionally, efforts are being made to mitigate the adverse impact on production capacity, safeguarding the ability of exporters to maintain output levels. A key priority is also placed on reactivating disrupted supply chains, restoring the seamless connectivity essential for efficient production and export processes. Through these targeted actions, the EDB aims to sustain export growth and build resilience against short-term obstacles.

The EDB is currently working closely with customs, port authorities, and logistics providers to manage infrastructure delays caused by adverse weather conditions and expedite export-related clearances.

Special Government attention has now been focused on assisting Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in particular to rapidly reactivate their operational capacity during this recovery process.

The discussion highlighted the growing intensity and frequency of climate-related challenges in recent times, underscoring the urgent need for proactive and sustainable responses. It was emphasised that addressing these environmental issues is not only critical for mitigating risks but also essential for ensuring long-term economic resilience. By integrating sustainability into export practices and promoting green technologies, the EDB aims to strengthen the export sector’s competitiveness and sustainability. This approach seeks to support exporters in adapting to climate realities while fostering greener and more resilient trade pathways that align with global environmental goals.
