Jaffna lawyers protest Police action

Lawyers in Jaffna yesterday staged a strike to protest what they described as an illegal search carried out by Police at the residence of a fellow attorney without court authorisation.

The protest followed an incident on Sunday in which police officers reportedly entered the home of a lawyer accused of involvement in land deed fraud and conducted a search in an attempt to arrest him. The search was allegedly conducted without a court warrant or prior judicial approval.

The incident comes amid ongoing police investigations into several lawyers suspected of participating in land deed fraud cases in the Jaffna area.

In response, members of the legal community gathered outside the Jaffna courts to condemn what they called a violation of legal procedure and professional rights.

Lawyers facing related allegations are expected to submit anticipatory bail applications to court today to prevent possible arrests.
