BOI woos US business think tanks

A 23-member US delegation, comprising senior representatives from leading American think tanks and private sector enterprises, recently paid a courtesy call on Board of Investment (BOI) of Sri Lanka Chairman Arjuna Herath.

The delegation included members from the Hudson Institute, the American Enterprise Institute, and executives representing the technology and human capital development sectors.

The meeting brought together senior Sri Lankan Government officials. The US delegation was led by Hudson Institute’s Prof. Walter Russell Mead.

In a statement, the BOI said discussions centred on strengthening economic ties, expanding investment opportunities, and Sri Lanka’s strategic role in a rapidly evolving geopolitical landscape.

Prof. Mead explained that the delegation was keen to understand Sri Lanka’s economic transformation, regional positioning, and development priorities. Delegation members engaged in discussion on a wide range of topics including the investment climate, technology adoption, and real estate development.

Herath said: “We are determined to maintain macroeconomic stability while fostering growth. Our Government is firmly market-oriented, working closely with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to ensure fiscal discipline, eliminate corruption, and promote good governance. Sri Lanka’s economic trajectory is strong, forward-looking, and open for business.”

On geopolitical matters, Sri Lankan officials reaffirmed the country’s longstanding non-aligned foreign policy, maintaining constructive relations with all major powers while safeguarding national interests. They said Sri Lanka remained neutral and independent in its external relations, while ties with the US were historic and enduring.

The BOI highlighted Sri Lanka’s strategic advantages for investors: a highly educated and trainable, English-speaking workforce; a strategic location along major East-West shipping routes; and competitive opportunities in high-growth sectors such as logistics, renewable energy, technology, pharmaceuticals, minerals, apparel, tourism, and real estate development.

Officials also outlined several upcoming initiatives, including specialised economic zones for technology, textiles, and pharmaceuticals, new digital economy initiatives, and expanded opportunities in port logistics and industrial infrastructure, supported by upcoming regulatory reforms to further foster strategic investments.

When asked about Sri Lanka’s message to US investors, the BOI Chief said: “We remain open, transparent, and eager to work with US partners. Our focus is on fostering a positive narrative that reflects Sri Lanka’s recovery, resilience, and readiness to welcome investment.”
