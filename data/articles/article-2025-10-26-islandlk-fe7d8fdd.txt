Sri Lankan innovation in early disease detection wins top ICT award

In a story that highlights Sri Lanka’s growing potential in life-saving technology, MedTech entrepreneur Keerthi Kodithuwakku was honoured as the CSSL ICT Leader of the Year (Male) 2024. The award recognises a groundbreaking local discovery: an AI-powered, non-invasive system that can detect early-stage vascular diseases in just 15 minutes.

Developed by Kodithuwakku’s company, Jendo Innovations, this technology addresses a critical global health challenge. Vascular diseases claim nearly 18 million lives annually, often without prior symptoms. Traditional diagnostic methods are invasive, expensive, and typically only identify the disease after significant damage has occurred.

Jendo’s breakthrough transforms this paradigm by providing a comprehensive vascular health report quickly and cost-effectively. This enables timely intervention and has the potential to save millions of lives worldwide, making advanced diagnostics accessible to every community, not just major hospitals.

What began as a university research project is now a multi-million dollar biomedical startup. Kodithuwakku dedicated the award to his team, stating it belongs to every innovator at Jendo “who believed in creating technology that heals.” Their success positions Sri Lanka as an emerging hub for transformative biomedical innovation.
