New ATA Chair champions Asia’s small tea farmers, unveils ambitious agenda

In his inaugural address as the new Chairman of the Asia Tea Alliance (ATA), Nimal Udugampola placed the region’s millions of smallholders at the core of the global tea industry’s future, asserting they are the “indispensable engine” of a sector that produces over 90% of the world’s tea.

Udugampola, who is also Chairman of Sri Lanka’s Tea Smallholdings Development Authority, used his speech at the 6th ATA Summit held in Colombo on Nov. 27 to declare that the prosperity of Asian tea is “entirely contingent” on the resilience of its small-scale farmers, who have historically been overlooked by premium global markets.

“In Sri Lanka, smallholders account for over 75% of our national production. Across Asia, millions of families maintain the quality and character of our regional teas,” he stated, accepting the chairmanship for the 2025-2027 term.

To empower this vital community, Udugampola unveiled a vision focused on Sustainability, Equity, and Digital Transformation. The strategic agenda includes:

Climate Resilience: Promoting climate-smart agriculture and regenerative farming to protect smallholdings from environmental disruption.

Digital Equity: Leveraging technology like blockchain to create farm-to-cup traceability, connecting smallholders directly with premium consumers and ensuring fair value.

Market Expansion: Driving innovation in tea products and marketing to attract younger consumers and enter non-traditional markets.

Standard Harmonization: Establishing common regional quality and sustainability standards to protect the “Asian Tea” brand and push for stable, fair pricing.

Linking the alliance’s goals to national ambition, Udugampola highlighted Sri Lanka’s target of producing 400 million kilograms of tea by 2030. He presented the country’s “Pivithuru Tea Initiative” as a model for other ATA nations, designed to achieve this through smallholder empowerment, digitalization, and aligned policy objectives.
