First international tour for Seven Notes

The Seven Notes, made up of Sri Lankans, based in Dubai, has reached an exciting milestone in their journey – their very first international performance.

Known for creating memorable moments through their music, they recently staged a successful event in Bahrain, followed by a powerful show in Dubai, and are now looking ahead to upcoming events in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.

Their international journey began in Bahrain, on 25th September, where this versatile outfit delivered a high-energy performance to an enthusiastic crowd.

The event gained even more momentum with the presence of Bachi Suzan, a renowned Sinhalese singer, known for his deep bass voice, whose appearance added glamour and excitement.

The night turned into a memorable success, marking Seven Notes’ first international appearance.

Two days later, the band was back on home ground (Dubai) for an unforgettable performance on 27th September. This event featured the talented Rahal Alwis, whose collaboration with Seven Notes elevated the evening into another grand success. The synergy on stage proved why Seven Notes continues to be one of the region’s most versatile and in-demand live bands.

Building on this momentum, they are now preparing for two more high-profile international shows: Saudi Arabia – 28th November, and Kuwait – 27th December.

In Saudi, they will be performing at the first annual Sri Lankan Quality Surveyors get-together, scheduled to take place at the Holiday Inn Al Qasr Riyadh.

This event, they say, will bring together professionals, industry leaders, and special guests, for an unforgettable night of networking, fine dining, exciting raffles, and entertainment, in the form of Corrine Almeida, Roy Jackson, and Romesh Sugathapala, with Seven Notes providing the music.

These performances highlight the band’s growing recognition across the region and their ability to connect with diverse audiences.

For Seven Notes, these international tours are more than a set of shows—it represents the start of a new international chapter.

Having captivated audiences in Dubai and beyond, the band is now bringing its passion, rhythm, and energy to stages across the Middle East, proudly showcasing music without boundaries.
