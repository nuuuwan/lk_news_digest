The Trapped Titan: Mahinda at Eighty

Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa celebrated his eightieth birthday on Nov.18th. Whether we admire or despise his politics, there is no denying that he decisively shaped the destiny of this island for decades, and his imprint will linger for generations. Understanding Mahinda Rajapaksa is crucial not merely as a study of one man, but as a lens through which to examine the interplay of society, religion, and charisma—the forces that both elevated him and ultimately constrained him. To scrutinize his trajectory is to confront the anatomy of a political phenomenon, the philosophical tragedy of a “big man,” and the distortion of institutions when personality eclipses principle.

Mahinda rose to prominence in a moment of decisive national crisis. At the close of a decades-long civil war, he embodied the image of a saviour, a warrior-statesman, echoing Pericles rallying Athens during the Peloponnesian wars or Augustus consolidating Rome after civil chaos. Weber’s concept of charismatic authority is indispensable here: Mahinda commanded not merely office but loyalty, belief, and symbolic legitimacy. “Charisma,” Weber argued, “is a certain quality of an individual personality by virtue of which he is set apart from ordinary men and treated as endowed with supernatural, superhuman, or at least specifically exceptional powers or qualities.” For Mahinda, the powers were political rather than mystical, yet society projected onto him its anxieties, hopes, and collective identity in identical fashion.

Yet charisma, as Weber warned, is inherently unstable. Unlike Augustus, who transformed personal power into legal and bureaucratic frameworks, or Pericles, who entwined civic virtue with democratic rituals, Mahinda remained essentially a man of personal devotion, surrounded by family and loyalists who reflected his will rather than challenged it. The irony is brutal: the very admiration that elevated him also blinded him. As the populace celebrated him and his inner circle echoed every gesture, he became increasingly incapable of distinguishing genuine strategy from flattery, principle from applause. In the post-war era, Mahinda was more than a politician; he was a symbol, a vessel of hope, and an avatar of nationalist Buddhist identity. Yet symbols do not govern—they are interpreted, projected upon, and inevitably misread.

The post-war period exposed the fragility of personalised power. Charisma, Weber insisted, must either routinise into institutional authority or dissipate. Mahinda’s independence eroded precisely because those around him began to worship the symbol more than the substance. Advisors, loyalists, and even family members treated public exaltation as justification for actions divorced from reasoned governance. Buddhism, historically decentralised and sustained by lay support rather than political authority, was increasingly mobilised to serve personal legitimacy. His rhetoric and gestures drew on a century of nationalist Buddhist revival, echoing the dynamics Prof S. J. Tambiah and Prof Gananath Obeyesekere described: a tradition transformed into a vehicle for political identity and mass mobilisation. The irony is profound: a philosophy rooted in impermanence became instrumentalised in pursuit of permanence for a single human agent.

This manipulation of religious authority was neither accidental nor purely symbolic. Mahinda’s administration drew on multiple religious institutions, including the Catholic Church, each eager to assert its relevance in a post-war state. In doing so, he became dependent upon them. His ideology—once framed in terms of national unity and reconstruction—shifted under the weight of symbolic expectation. Like Augustus leveraging Roman religion to consolidate authority or Pericles entwining civic and religious pride to fortify the polis, Mahinda’s political philosophy became inseparable from the very structures that ultimately constrained him. Ironically, he was pathetically used by the Catholic Church just as the Buddhist clergy, in many instances, deliberately ignored opportunities for much-needed structural reform.

The result was inevitable: a gradual unraveling of independence, first political, then familial. The network that had amplified his authority became the very mechanism of limitation. Loyalty, combined with unexamined adulation, became a cage. Siblings and inner circle, once instruments of his will, transformed into mirrors reflecting public desire, amplifying triumphs and shielding him from critique. Mahinda did not merely lose power externally; he became politically incapacitated within his own household—a tragic inversion of the charismatic logic that had elevated him. In Lacanian terms, the “mirror stage” of collective projection trapped the subject within the desires of the Other, leaving him blindfolded by affection, rejoicing in praise while losing touch with reality.

Mahinda’s trajectory invites reflection on history, power, and social perception. There is a Nietzschean aspect to his rise and fall: a temporary Übermensch, a man transcending conventional norms, becoming the axis of collective aspiration. Yet, like all such figures, he confronts mortality, social expectation, and human frailty. The worship that initially empowered him became the instrument of his constraint. Camus’ notion of absurdity is pertinent: the man who once seemed invincible confronts the absurdity of societal projection—a populace demanding permanence from an impermanent human agent.

The post-war narrative also illustrates the perils of historical contingency and generational expectation. Unlike South Korea or Singapore, where leaders institutionalised authority to endure beyond their lifetimes, Mahinda’s charisma remained personalistic. The “big man” syndrome, familiar in many post-colonial contexts, collided with democratic volatility, economic pressures, and familial rivalry. There was no proceduralisation, no legal-rational scaffolding to transform adulation into sustainable governance. In Weberian terms, Mahinda failed to routinise charisma into institutional power, leaving a paradoxical legacy: national reverence intertwined with political paralysis.

At eighty, Mahinda Rajapaksa stands as both relic and warning. His life embodies the intersection of ambition, social projection, and religious symbolism. The distortion of Buddhist revivalism and the co-option of religious institutions into political legitimacy expose the fragility of governance when entwined with mass adoration. The post-war period, marked by triumph and symbolic sacralisation, mirrors ancient precedents: Augustus employed ritual to consolidate Rome, Pericles entwined civic pride with political control. In both cases, institutionalisation buffered the collapse; Mahinda, by contrast, illustrates the limits of unmediated charisma: the man adored becomes the man trapped, the nation that worshipped becomes constrained by expectation.

History rarely permits the return of such personalities. No successor embodies his post-war symbolic and political capital. Minor attempts to imitate him falter because the phenomenon was both personal and era-specific. Mahinda’s eightieth year is not merely a birthday; it is a prism to examine society, religion, and political psychology. It reminds us that leadership demands not only decisiveness or heroism, but also foresight, management of adulation, and ethical stewardship of symbolic power.

Mahinda Rajapaksa’s life chronicles the collision of human expectation with impermanence. Society elevated him, religious institutions sanctified him, family amplified him—yet each contributed to his political constriction. The charismatic paradox is blunt: the greater the worship, the narrower the freedom; the more profound the symbol, the sharper the distortion. Sri Lanka’s history, and the philosophical lessons of political life, require that we study such figures not only for their deeds, but for the dynamics they expose: the societies that exalt them, the ideologies they embody, and the vulnerabilities inevitable in human aspiration.
