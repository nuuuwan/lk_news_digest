Norfolk Foods introduces Crumbs by Crescent at Culinary Art Food Expo 2025

Norfolk Foods (Pvt) Ltd, a pioneer in the Sri Lankan frozen food industry, has expanded its product portfolio with the introduction of Crumbs by Crescent, a frozen bakery solution designed to bring restaurant-quality taste and convenience to both households and professional kitchens.

First unveiled at the Culinary Art Food Expo 2025, Crumbs by Crescent has since become a significant step in Norfolk Foods’ ongoing mission to innovate and respond to the changing needs of Sri Lankan consumers. The range covers an extensive selection of pizzas, pastries, buns, pies, muffins, and other savoury and sweet treats, all crafted with high-quality ingredients and designed to deliver oven-fresh flavour in minutes.

The Culinary Art Food Expo served as a launchpad for the brand, where chefs from leading star-class hotels sampled the products and offered positive feedback. Many highlighted how the range could seamlessly complement hotel buffets, high teas, and à la carte menus, while also serving as a convenient, ready-to-bake option for restaurants and caterers.

Speaking on the launch, Ms. Ameena Ziauddin, President of Norfolk Foods, said, “Crumbs by Crescent marks a new chapter for Norfolk Foods as we expand beyond our established vegetarian, meat, and poultry-based portfolio to offer bakery solutions for both homes and hospitality.”
