CHEC South Asia & Southeast Asia completes emergency clearing of A5 highway after Cyclone Ditwah

China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd., South Asia & Southeast Asia, working in close coordination with the Sri Lanka Army, the Road Development Authority (RDA), local authorities and surrounding communities, has recently completed the emergency clearing of the A5 highway, restoring a vital transportation link that had been severely obstructed by landslides and debris in the aftermath of Cyclone Ditwah. The work was carried out from 4 December to 10 December over a continuous seven-day period.

The A5 highway, a key route for community connectivity, emergency service access and the transport of essential supplies, became impassable after the cyclone triggered extensive damage across multiple regions. Responding to urgent requests from relevant authorities, China Harbour South Asia & Southeast Asia mobilised its specialised rescue teams, heavy machinery and technical expertise to accelerate the clearance process and support national recovery operations. China Harbour has been working in Sri Lanka since 1998, marking 27 years of partnership with the country. The company noted that it has also actively participated in rescue and relief efforts during major national disasters such as tsunamis, bomb attacks and the COVID-19 pandemic, underscoring its longstanding commitment to Sri Lanka during moments of crisis.

A coordinated ground operation involving rescue personnel, 24 land-clearing machines and 36 trained workers was deployed to the affected areas. Working through unstable terrain and challenging weather conditions, the team removed large volumes of earth, fallen trees, rocks and damaged structures, allowing authorities to safely reopen the highway for public use.

The restoration of the A5 highway forms an important component of the company’s broader relief efforts following Cyclone Ditwah. These efforts included early rescue deployments, the distribution of emergency supplies and coordinated financial support through the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Sri Lanka (CCCSL), reaffirming China Harbour South Asia & Southeast Asia’s commitment to supporting the country during times of national need.

China Harbour South Asia & Southeast Asia Deputy General Manager Xu Liqiang said, “Cyclone Ditwah brought unprecedented challenges to Sri Lanka, and as a long-term partner to the nation, we felt a responsibility to respond quickly and effectively. The reopening of the A5 highway is a critical milestone in restoring mobility, supporting relief work and helping communities return to stability. We are deeply grateful to all teams on the ground who worked tirelessly under difficult conditions, and we remain committed to providing continued assistance as Sri Lanka moves forward with its recovery.”

China Harbour South Asia & Southeast Asia confirmed that it will continue to support government agencies, local authorities and affected communities with technical expertise, machinery and manpower as the country undertakes the complex process of rebuilding after this severe natural disaster.
