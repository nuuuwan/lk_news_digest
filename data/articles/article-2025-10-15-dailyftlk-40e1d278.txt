CEB unions suspend strike

All trade unions of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) yesterday decided to suspend the trade union action they launched on 4 September following discussions with Energy Minister Kumara Jayakody.

CEB Engineers’ Union Executive Committee Member Dhanushka Parakramasinghe said the decision was reached after the Minister agreed to all 24 proposals submitted by the unions. He noted that the unions will call off their action once a written assurance is received from the Minister.

“The Minister has accepted our 24 proposals and agreed to provide a written commitment. Once we receive that, all unions will suspend their ongoing trade union action,” Parakramasinghe said, adding that the written assurance was expected shortly.
