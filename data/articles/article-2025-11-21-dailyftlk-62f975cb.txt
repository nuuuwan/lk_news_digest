President Anura Kumara Dissanayake yesterday pledged an uncompromising, years-long national campaign to dismantle Sri Lanka’s drug networks, warning that the country’s future is at risk unless the “deeply rooted” drug economy and its political links are eliminated.

Addressing the Southern Province program of the “A Nation United” mission at the Tangalle Public Stadium, the President said drug addiction and the parallel criminal economy have devastated families, fuelled organised crime, and corrupted parts of the State system.

He said hundreds of thousands of youth have fallen victim to addiction, collapsing family units and driving widespread fear across communities.

“A country cannot progress when burdened by drug-related crime and corruption. This menace has engulfed the future of our nation,” he asserted.

Dissanayake accused past political leaders of nurturing armed groups and underworld figures linked to drug trafficking, giving them protection and influence within State structures.

“Underworld leaders once sat on political executive committees and even worked within Presidential security divisions,” he said, adding that the present Government provides “no political protection to any criminal.”

The President said the tri-forces, Police, intelligence agencies, and the Navy are now working in a coordinated nationwide operation to shut down smuggling networks, intercept shipments, and dismantle distribution chains.

He noted that drug entry routes have evolved from airport smuggling into containerised shipments, boats, and even local drug-manufacturing setups.

“This is not a mission of catching a boat and issuing a press release. It requires long-term, uninterrupted operations spanning several years. We will continue until this scourge is defeated,” he said.

He confirmed active cooperation with foreign Governments, with several drug-network members arrested overseas and others being pursued for extradition.

To strengthen grassroots action, the Public Security Ministry is establishing Public Security Committees at the village level to encourage citizens to report illegal activities without fear. “Villagers know who suddenly amass massive wealth. Fear must no longer silence them,” he added.

Dissanayake also highlighted expanded investment for drug rehabilitation, announcing rehabilitation centres in every district. He said addiction often reflects societal failure rather than individual fault. “We must return these lost children to their parents,” he said.

The President cautioned that drug traffickers possess massive illicit wealth that can influence narratives, intimidate officials, and attempt to derail Government operations.

He warned of both visible threats such as intimidation of security-force families and invisible ones: misinformation campaigns, political sabotage, and fabricated crises.

Citing global examples including Haiti and Mexico, he said criminal networks often attempt to manipulate public opinion when threatened. “Their aim is to weaken the mission, not necessarily to target officers directly,” he warned.

Dissanayake insisted that any political forces attempting to undermine the anti-drug mission would be countered “through political means,” stressing that no officials will be used for political activity.

“This battle is much broader than law enforcement versus offenders. We will confront and defeat the political front that seeks to undermine this mission,” he said.

The President closed with an appeal for a united front across the Government, security forces, religious leaders, and the public.

“We have a professional Police and armed forces. If the State machinery, the Maha Sangha, religious leaders, and citizens unite, we can overcome this crisis,” he said. “Our decision is firm and unwavering. We will intensify our efforts each day until this menace is completely eliminated.”
