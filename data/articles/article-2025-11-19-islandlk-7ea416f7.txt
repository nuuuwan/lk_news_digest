‘Belavia Airlines flying to Sri Lanka augurs well for country’s tourism’

There has been a steady rise in passenger movement between Belarus and Sri Lanka in recent years, reflecting both the growing appeal of Sri Lanka as a travel destination for Belarusians and the increasing number of Sri Lankan students pursuing higher education in Belarus.

This observation was made by Mikhail Kasko, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of Belarus to India, concurrently accredited to Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, at the launch of Belavia Airlines’ new direct flight to Mattala, through a strategic partnership with Far East Air Services (FEAS).

The envoy stressed that Belavia Airlines flying to Sri Lanka augurs well for the country’s tourism industry.

He noted that a large number of Sri Lankan medical professionals have completed their studies in Belarus, underscoring the strength of academic ties between the two nations. In this context, the launch of the new direct flight represents a natural step forward in deepening cooperation between Minsk and Colombo.

Uladzimir Barkun, Deputy Director General – Marketing and International Affairs, Belavia Airlines, described the launch as a historic milestone in Belarusian civil aviation.

“Belavia Airlines marked a historic moment with the commencement of its regular Minsk–Mattala–Minsk service, the airline’s 16th international destination,” he said.

“The inaugural flight achieved a full load factor, reflecting strong demand and confidence in this new route. This marks Belavia’s third long-haul connection, following recent launches to Sanya (China) and Phu Quoc (Vietnam), reaffirming our commitment to expanding international partnerships and sustainable growth.”

Sunil Jayarathne, Chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority of Sri Lanka, emphasized that partnerships of this nature not only enhance Sri Lanka’s global connectivity but also significantly contribute to tourism, trade, and overall economic growth.

Sanjaya Dahanayagamaarachchi, Chairman of Antiquity / Luxury Holidays, highlighted Sri Lanka’s immense potential as a premier travel destination, offering a unique blend of natural beauty, culture, and hospitality.

He noted that enhanced air connectivity will enable the island’s tourism industry to showcase its diverse offerings — from heritage and wellness to adventure and luxury — further strengthening Sri Lanka’s position on the global tourism map.

Far East Air Services (FEAS), headquartered in Colombo, is a leading provider of comprehensive logistics and aviation solutions, driven by the vision and leadership of Andrea Dhanapala, Chairman and Managing Director.
