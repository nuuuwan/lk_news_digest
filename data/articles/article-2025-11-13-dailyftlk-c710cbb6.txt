Govt. to pilot pipeline irrigation projects to combat drought and crop losses in dry zones

$ 3.3 m grant from Japan Fund for Prosperous and Resilient Asia and the Pacific, channelled via ADB, and $ 1.68 m contribution from GoSL

The Cabinet of Ministers has approved the implementation of four pilot pipeline irrigation projects across the North Western and Uva provinces, aiming to reduce water wastage, support small-scale farmers, and improve crop yields in Sri Lanka’s drought-prone dry zones.

Sri Lanka’s small-scale cultivators in the dry zone have faced declining crop harvests due to prolonged droughts and the destruction of soil-based irrigation channels caused by increasingly intense rains. To address these challenges, the Government has proposed a pipeline distribution system to replace the traditional open irrigation channels, which have limited water-carrying capacity.

Under the plan, four pilot projects covering a total agricultural area of 877 hectares will be established, showcasing three distinct pipeline irrigation models. The projects are intended to minimise water loss, provide relief to farmers affected by drought, and encourage small landowners to cultivate higher-value food crops. An additional objective is to increase female participation in the agricultural sector.

Funding for the initiative will be drawn from multiple sources, including a $3.3 million grant from the Japan Foundation for Prosperous and Resilient Asia and the Pacific (JFPR), supplied via the Asian Development Bank, alongside $1.68 million from the Government.

The Cabinet’s approval, proposed by the Minister of Agriculture, Livestock, Lands, and Irrigation, marks a significant step in modernising irrigation infrastructure, enhancing agricultural resilience, and supporting sustainable livelihoods for farmers in vulnerable regions of Sri Lanka.
