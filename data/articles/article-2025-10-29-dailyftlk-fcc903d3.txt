Police launch probe into officers over video of Weligama PS Chairman murder suspect’s arrest

The Sri Lanka Police have launched a special investigation into the conduct of officers involved in the arrest of the suspect wanted in connection with the murder of Weligama Pradeshiya Sabha Chairman Lasantha Wickramasekara, following the circulation of video footage of the arrest on social media.

Speaking to the media, Police Spokesman ASP F.U. Wootler said the Inspector General of Police (IGP) has paid special attention to the matter and directed that the inquiry be carried out by a special investigation unit.

“The probe will focus on the recording and public dissemination of the arrest video, which quickly spread across multiple social media platforms,” he added. ASP Wootler noted that publicising such footage, while a case is under judicial consideration could potentially interfere with court proceedings and affect the rights of the aggrieved parties.

The suspect, identified as the alleged gunman in the murder of the Weligama PS Chairman, was arrested in the Navinna area in Maharagama on 26 October.

Meanwhile, legal experts have expressed serious concern over the growing trend of Police officers sharing videos of suspects on mainstream and social media. They warned that such practices could compromise investigations and undermine the integrity of future prosecutions.

Former Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) President Saliya Pieris PC, in a Facebook post, stressed that arrests and criminal investigations must be conducted strictly in accordance with the law.

He cautioned that “parading suspects before the media, obtaining voice cuts from them, and circulating those clips on media and social media platforms may thrill certain sections of the public, but will not help the prosecution once the trial begins.”

The incident has reignited debate over ethical standards and media protocols governing law enforcement, with legal professionals calling for strict adherence to due process and the protection of suspects’ rights until proven guilty in courts.
