Urgent repairs planned for historic Nuwara Eliya Post Office amid heritage conservation push

Holds review meeting to restore 130-year-old colonial-era Post Office as heritage tourism site

Explores selection of conservation experts to undertake renovation work in line with heritage standards

The Government has moved to fast-track urgent repairs at the 130-year-old Nuwara Eliya Post Office, with officials directed to prepare immediate renovation plans to safeguard the building’s heritage and improve facilities for visitors.

A special discussion chaired by Health and Mass Media Minister Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa was held recently at the Ministry to review the progress of plans to restore the 130-year-old Nuwara Eliya Post Office and transform it into a key heritage attraction for both local and foreign tourists.

The meeting brought together officials from the Department of Posts, Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA), Department of Archaeology, Department of Buildings, Sri Lanka Navy, and Health and Mass Media Ministry. The focus was on preserving the architectural and historical significance of the colonial-era landmark, whilst ensuring it continues to function as a fully operational post office.

The Nuwara Eliya Post Office has been at the centre of public debate following reports that the previous Government had intended to transfer the property to a private company. The current administration, however, has ruled out privatisation, affirming that the post office and its premises will remain under the Department of Posts, while being developed as a tourism promotion site.

The meeting paid particular attention to the urgent need for roof repairs, as the building has fallen into a state of disrepair and currently leaks during rainfall, causing inconvenience to postal employees, customers, and visitors. It was agreed that roof restoration will be the first priority, followed by a series of conservation efforts designed to protect the building’s historic character.

Officials also discussed the selection of suitable designers and conservation experts to undertake the renovation work in accordance with heritage preservation standards.

Minister Dr. Jayatissa instructed the relevant departments to prepare preliminary renovation plans and expedite the restoration process, ensuring that the building’s antiquity is safeguarded while improving facilities for visitors.

Once complete, the restoration is expected to breathe new life into one of Nuwara Eliya’s most recognisable landmarks, blending functional modernisation with heritage conservation to enhance the town’s appeal as a heritage tourism destination.

Health and Mass Media Ministry Additional Secretaries Salinda Bandara and S.D. Padikorala, Senior Assistant Secretary W.D.N.M. Abeysekara, Postmaster General Ruwan Sathkumara, Deputy Postmaster General Thusitha Hulangamuwa, and officials representing the SLTDA, Department of Archaeology, Department of Buildings, and Sri Lanka Navy were also present on this occasion.
