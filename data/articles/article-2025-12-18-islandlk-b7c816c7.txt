Noshin De Silva Adventurous, happy, calm, and forward

Actress, artist, model Noshin De Silva is not new to our scene.

She was in the spotlight in the Thursday Island of 20th November, 2025, where her acting career, in the movie ‘Rayak Ho Payak’  was highlighted.

This week, Noshin does the needful in our Chit-Chat feature:

I would describe myself as a creative soul with a curious mind. I feel deeply, love storytelling, and look for beauty in small moments. For people who don’t know me, I would say I am someone who sees the glass half full, someone who is adventurous, happy, calm, and forward.

2. If you could change one thing about yourself, what would it be?

I can think of more than one. I know I am not perfect, but I take pride in always doing my best and giving my all. I love learning, growing, and becoming a better version of myself for me, for the people around me, and for the world. My doctor once told me that I am someone who likes to keep evolving, and I agree with her.

3. If you could change one thing about your family, what would it be?

Nothing at all. I am grateful that we are so close. We feel like soulmates. We always support each other, and I truly treasure that.

I was raised in Japan, until age 12, and completed the rest of my education, including my Master’s degree in International Business, in the United States. In Japan, I participated in school plays, which sparked my love for acting. I played piano, began swimming at age six, and competed on school swim teams, in both Japan and the US. After moving to the States, I took up track and cross country and loved running. I also need to add that I danced in Japan and began oil painting around age nine. I won school and national art competitions in both countries. In High School, I was also active in many clubs, including Model UN, Key Club, Science Club, Art Club, and more. One special memory was when my High School principal asked me to paint a large mural inside the school. I spent half my summer break working on it. When it was featured in the city newspaper I felt so happy seeing something I created spread positivity and inclusion to others.”

This is difficult because I try to find happiness in everyday moments. I’m a simple person, and I try to view life in a simple, grateful way. If I had to choose, any moment where I’m able to give love, feel loved, and feel peaceful, while surrounded by my loved ones, would be my happiest.

Perfect happiness to me is spreading love, having peace of mind, creating meaningful connections, living freely, and doing what I love. In Japanese, there is a phrase called Chijo Tengoku, which means Heaven on Earth. That is my idea of perfect happiness.

I am spiritual more than religious. I believe in God, energy, intuition, and karma. I believe in Lord Buddha and his teachings. I pray, and I also trust in the universe.

Not really. I do believe in signs and in the idea that the universe supports you. I believe everything happens for a reason, and I try to keep my energy clean and positive.

My ideal guy is someone I can admire, respect, and feel inspired by. Someone who loves life and carries confidence in a humble way. A man who is handsome inside and out. I do have a list of qualities that I look for in a man, but I will keep that to myself. Above all, a genuinely good heart matters the most. You can pretend to be anything, but you cannot pretend to have a good heart.

My mother. She is also my best friend. Her resilience, positivity, bravery, and unconditional love inspire me every day. She overcomes any obstacle with courage and hard work. She can walk into any room and connect with anyone. She has helped many families long before I was even born. Seeing lives transform because of her is inspiring. I am proud and blessed to be her daughter.

I have two: First, my family. We are extremely close, we inspire each other, and we are loyal to one another. Second, my childhood in Japan. Although I am ethnically Sri Lankan, I was born and raised in Japan, until the age 12, and then moved to the United States. I carry three cultures within me. Japan is where I discovered my artistic side, including acting, dancing, piano, painting, and performing. I like to say Japan made me who I am, and the US shaped me into who I am capable of becoming.

12. If you were marooned on a desert island, who would you like as your companion?

Definitely my brother. He is athletic, strong, smart, and can fix anything. I would bring the ideas and he would bring the strength. We would survive just fine!

Yes, during shooting … recently. I had to pretend to park a motorcycle. I was so into acting that when I tried to park, I fell right on my butt. Everyone laughed, and it became a great ice breaker. Every embarrassing moment seems to be followed by an even funnier one.

Climbing to the top of the tallest building in the world, the Burj Khalifa. I’m not a big fan of heights, and I was nervous, but it was worth it. It felt so magical to see the world from above the clouds. It’s one of the most special experiences I’ve ever had.

Any walkable city with beautiful history, art, culture, and amazing restaurants. I love exploring new places, museums, and delicious food.

I love R&B, Chill Pop, and Latin music. I also love Instrumental Jazz. It really soothes my soul, especially before important days.

Boston’s Jammin 94.5. It is the station I grew up listening to.

Rupavahini. It was the first TV network I appeared on as a guest, at age 10, so it holds a very special place in my heart.

I am not sure. I am grateful that acting already allows me to live many different lives. What I truly wish is to be with my loved ones again in the next life.

I want to continue growing as an actor and expand creatively. I would love to take on complex, bold, and emotionally challenging roles. Cinema and the film world have always given me strength, especially during times when I felt alone. If I can be a part of strength or inspiration for someone, that would mean a lot to me. I also have a couple of projects coming up next year, and I will announce them at the right time.
