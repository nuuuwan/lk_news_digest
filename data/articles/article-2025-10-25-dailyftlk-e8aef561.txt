Sampath Bank has reaffirmed its unwavering support for Sri Lanka’s export community by renewing its partnership with the National Chamber of Exporters (NCE) for 2025. The agreement, signed recently at the Sampath Bank Head Office, marks another chapter in the Bank’s long-standing collaboration with the NCE, further strengthening its role as a trusted financial partner to exporters across the country.

Through this renewed partnership, Sampath Bank will continue to promote ethical trading and sustainable business practices within the export sector. In today’s global marketplace, where fair trade, environmental responsibility and sustainable development are increasingly vital, the NCE’s Certificate of Ethical Trading (CET) serves as a valuable benchmark for exporters seeking international competitiveness. Recognising its importance, the NCE, as the only trade chamber in Sri Lanka to issue such certification, guides its members in establishing strong governance systems and practices. The Certificate validates an organisation’s commitment to ethical operations, builds buyer confidence, and enhances market credibility. As part of this partnership, Sampath Bank will sponsor 30 member companies to obtain the certification, reflecting the Bank’s belief that integrity and responsibility are essential to long-term economic progress.

Sampath Bank PLC Assistant General Manager – International Banking Halin Hettigoda said, “Exporters continue to play a defining role in revitalising Sri Lanka’s economy. At Sampath Bank, we remain deeply committed to empowering them through responsible banking, ethical trade support, and financial innovation. Our ongoing partnership with the NCE reflects this shared vision to strengthen the export sector and build a more resilient and inclusive economy.”

The partnership will also provide Sampath Bank with significant brand visibility across the NCE’s large-scale technical seminars that bring together key industry stakeholders to discuss vital trade and policy issues. These platforms encourage innovation, knowledge exchange, and collaboration within the export community. In addition, the Bank will take part in the NCE’s Regional Exporters Delegation, offering opportunities to engage directly with regional producers and suppliers while promoting financial inclusion and stronger export linkages across the country.

The collaboration will culminate at the 33rd Annual NCE Export Awards, scheduled for 13 February 2026 at the Shangri-La Hotel, Colombo, where outstanding exporters will be recognised. Through this partnership, Sampath Bank continues its commitment to advancing sustainable trade and empowering Sri Lankan exporters to achieve success in global markets.
