Prime Group stands with children of police families affected by Cyclone Ditwah

In the aftermath of Cyclone Ditwah, while Sri Lanka Police officers worked tirelessly to safeguard lives and property across the country, many of their own families endured significant hardship. Recognizing this silent struggle, Prime Group launched a national-level initiative to support the children of affected police families, providing essential educational supplies and ensuring that their education could continue uninterrupted despite the challenges they faced.

Prime Group supplied essential school materials to children affected by Cyclone Ditwah, helping them resume their studies with confidence and dignity. Through this initiative, undertaken as a responsible corporate citizen, 1000 students across Sri Lanka received support, with an investment of LKR 10 million.

Sandamini Perera, Co-Chairperson of Prime Group stated, “Prime Group is honored to stand with police families and support their children, as a gesture of gratitude for the selfless service rendered to our country. Despite facing personal loss and hardship, the officers of the Sri Lanka Police continued to serve the nation with unwavering dedication during Cyclone Ditwah. Their commitment to safeguarding communities under the most challenging circumstances deserves our deepest respect.”
