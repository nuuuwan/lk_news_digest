All teachers to become degree holders under new education reforms – PM Harini

Prime Minister and Education, Higher Education, and Vocational Education Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya told Parliament yesterday that the Government aims to make all teachers degree holders as part of ongoing education reforms.

Speaking during the parliamentary debate on education sector changes, she said teacher training colleges had seen little reform in decades and required both structural and curriculum upgrades. “This is not just a matter of funding – there has been insufficient focus on how these institutions function,” she noted.

Dr. Amarasuriya said a new curriculum will be introduced this year to align teacher training with national education reform goals. “Our priority is to produce teachers who meet the real needs of the country. We are already training both current trainees and those involved in teacher education,” she said.

She added that the government’s long-term goal is to elevate all teacher training colleges to degree-awarding institutions. “At present, only the Kuliyapitiya Teacher Training College grants degrees. We plan to raise the remaining 19 colleges to that same level,” the Prime Minister said.
