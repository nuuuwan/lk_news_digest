Maldives extends relief support of  $ 50,000 and 25,000 tuna cans to Sri Lanka

The Government of Maldives has decided to extend relief assistance to Sri Lanka through financial support of $ 50,000 and a donation of 25,000 cases of tuna cans.

The Government of Maldives took this decision to extend humanitarian and relief assistance on behalf of the Maldivian people to the people of Sri Lanka, in response to the widespread devastation caused by Cyclone Ditwah.

“This gesture is a demonstration of solidarity with our close neighbour and the friendly people of Sri Lanka. The Maldives hopes that this modest donation will contribute towards the efforts of the Government of Sri Lanka to assist those affected, reflecting the deep commitment to the close bonds shared between the two nations and their peoples,” it added.
