Landslide evacuation warning extended to four districts

The National Building and Research Organisation (NBRO) yesterday extended its Level-3 (Red) landslide evacuation warning for multiple areas across Kandy, Kegalle, Kurunegala and Matale, with the alert now in force until 4:00 p.m. today.

The highest-level warning requires residents in designated zones to evacuate immediately due to the risk of slope failures triggered by persistent rainfall.

Authorities urged the public to follow evacuation instructions and remain alert to changing ground conditions as saturated soil continues to pose severe landslide risks.
