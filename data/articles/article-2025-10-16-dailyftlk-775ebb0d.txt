PC polls to be held next year under old or new system: Lalkantha

Minister K.D. Lalkantha yesterday said the Government will hold Provincial Council (PC) elections next year, either under the existing system or after introducing a new electoral framework.

He told reporters that the elections could proceed under the previous system by amending the Bill already passed in Parliament. “We have a two-thirds majority and can pass the necessary legislation to hold the PC elections under the old system,” he said.

Responding to questions on whether the Opposition alliance would pose a challenge, the Minister dismissed the idea.

“The Opposition will not be an issue. We have a functioning Executive Presidency and 159 MPs working effectively. A new political culture has been established, and the people have confidence in the National People’s Power (NPP) Government and the local bodies it administers,” he said.
