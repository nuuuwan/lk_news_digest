How Lee Kuan Yew turned a small island into a global powerhouse

Singapore’s founding father, Lee Kuan Yew (LKY), explained in a guest lecture at Harvard University in October 2000 how he confronted national challenges and transformed a fragmented, vulnerable island into a unified, prosperous state. He outlined the principles that guided his leadership, how he won nine consecutive elections from 1959, and how he planned a smooth transition to a younger generation. His central message was clear: pragmatism, not dogma, is the essential quality of successful leadership in a turbulent geopolitical environment.

This article seeks to inform the public—and also our own President, AKD—who today appears to be embracing elements of the same pragmatic approach. LKY’s lessons on governance, meritocracy, succession planning, and national cohesion remain strikingly relevant.

Singapore became an independent state in 1965, a multiracial society of Chinese, Malays, Indians, and others who had arrived seeking opportunity but not nationhood. LKY recognised early that unity required practicality. He made English the working language—not to favour any group, but to avoid giving advantage to one. Mother tongues were preserved, and integration was encouraged through mixed public housing allocated by ballot.

LKY insisted that zero tolerance for corruption was non-negotiable. Good leaders, he argued, must make decisions that are right for the country even if they are unpopular at first. “Policies must be pragmatic, not dogmatic,” he warned, rejecting political correctness and conventional assumptions that ignored reality.

LKY emphasised that stability and good governance—not ideology—drive development. He criticised political systems where media manipulation, image-building, and spin overshadow competence. He argued that leaders like Churchill or Roosevelt could not emerge from election environments dominated by packaging rather than substance.

LKY studied the mistakes of many Third-World leaders. After independence, many adopted socialist, interventionist models that stifled enterprise and led to economic collapse. Nations such as Tanzania, Zambia, and others were led by well-intentioned but doctrinaire leaders who believed prosperity could be created by government decree rather than entrepreneurship.

He contrasted these failures with countries that permitted market forces to function, such as Kenya, which—despite corruption—achieved stronger economic outcomes.

World War II profoundly shaped LKY’s worldview. The collapse of British power, the cruelty of Japanese occupation, and the violent struggles that followed left deep impressions. These experiences convinced him that survival required self-reliance, national unity, and a realistic understanding of power.

After Singapore’s separation from Malaysia in 1965, LKY faced the urgent task of building a nation from scratch. The early years brought anxiety, not celebration.

Singapore’s survival depended on economic viability. LKY first attracted investors from Hong Kong and Taiwan, then from Europe, Japan, and the United States. China’s Cultural Revolution became an unexpected opportunity: major technology firms such as Texas Instruments and Hewlett-Packard relocated operations to Singapore.

Singapore offered what the region lacked: political stability, industrial peace, and English fluency. Within two decades Singapore became a global electronics hub.

LKY’s long-term strategy was to transform Singapore into a first-world environment that could attract global talent. World-class infrastructure—airport, seaport, telecommunications—was built, and public safety, health standards, and urban amenities were raised to international levels. Campaigns to improve courtesy, cleanliness, and civic behaviour reinforced the shift.

The “Garden City” initiative became one of Singapore’s most successful image-building efforts.

Singapore’s racial, linguistic, and cultural diversity required careful management. LKY rejected forced assimilation and instead encouraged bilingualism: English as the common working language, and mother tongues as cultural anchors.

Mixed housing policies prevented racial enclaves. National service built a shared sense of duty. Assistance from Israel helped create a credible defence force, essential for deterrence and national confidence.

LKY believed leaders must act as trustees of the nation, not beneficiaries of office. Clean government, strict accountability, and a politically neutral civil service were essential pillars. Corruption had to be defeated before it took root. Meritocracy was institutionalised through an independent Public Service Commission.

To bind citizens to the nation, LKY introduced mass home ownership through the Central Provident Fund. Today, more than 90% of Singaporean households own their homes. This sense of stakeholding strengthened national stability and social cohesion.

LKY rejected fashionable ideologies of his day—anti-Americanism, anti-multinationalism, and the belief that democracy is a prerequisite for development. He argued that honest, stable, effective government matters more than form.

Education was Singapore’s foundation for advancement. English-medium instruction expanded rapidly, supported by technical institutes, polytechnics, and universities. This prepared Singaporeans for global industries and secured the nation’s economic future.

LKY viewed leadership renewal as his greatest responsibility. Not every brilliant academic or PhD made a good minister. Psychological and psychometric testing were introduced to identify temperament, judgment, and resilience. Promising candidates were tested through political responsibility before being entrusted with higher office.

By the early 1990s, Singapore had a new generation of leaders capable of maintaining integrity and high standards.

Singapore’s judiciary became one of the most respected in Asia. Strong courts and predictable rules created public confidence and attracted investment.

LKY contrasted the crisis-driven leadership of his generation with the opinion-poll-driven politics of mature democracies. When Singapore faced existential threats in the 1960s, decisions had to be made quickly. Disorder, strikes, and racial tension could have destroyed the nation.

Integration in housing and schools was implemented decisively—not through endless debate—because the long-term national interest was clear.

Governments must use the mandate given by voters to exercise judgment, not govern by daily plebiscite. The revolutionary generation had trust and unity; later generations, raised in comfort, expect debate and consultation—both necessary but potentially paralysing if taken to excess.

LKY believed both innate qualities and historical necessity shape leaders. Crises produce statesmen; comfort produces managers. The examples of Mao and Deng, Churchill and Attlee, Reagan and Carter illustrate how circumstances shape leadership types.

LKY acknowledged his earlier support for absolute press freedom, but argued that in Singapore’s vulnerable early years, open debate on sensitive issues could have led to riots. Pragmatism, not ideology, guided his media policy.

= We are a multiracial, multireligious society with far greater natural resources than Singapore. Unity is our missing ingredient.

= English should serve as the working language for national integration and global competitiveness, while preserving mother tongues and faiths.

= Political leaders must act as trustees—not performers—and should be assessed through rigorous criteria, including psychometric testing.

= Citizens must reject destructive politics: strikes, agitation, and chaos only weaken the nation.

= An independent, professionally regulated judiciary is vital for investors’ confidence and public trust.

Sri Lanka can become a developed, independent nation. We need not align with any single geopolitical bloc; we can work with all for mutual benefit. But this requires pragmatism, unity, discipline, and clear-sighted leadership.

LKY’s lecture is essential viewing for both citizens and leaders.
