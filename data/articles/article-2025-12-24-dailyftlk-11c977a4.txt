Sri Lanka welcomes India’s continued support

Foreign Affairs, Foreign Employment and Tourism Minister Vijitha Herath yesterday expressed Sri Lanka’s deep appreciation to India for its swift and comprehensive assistance following the devastation caused by Cyclone Ditwah.

He described Indian External Affairs Minister Dr. S. Jaishankar’s visit to Colombo as a powerful reaffirmation of the enduring partnership between the two countries.

Welcoming Dr. Jaishankar in joint press briefing held at the Presidential Secretariat, Herath said the visit underscored India’s “steadfast solidarity” with Sri Lanka in a moment of national difficulty and reflected New Delhi’s role as a first responder, particularly through the timely launch of Operation Sagar Bandu.

He conveyed Sri Lanka’s gratitude on behalf of President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, the Government and the people to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Government of India and Dr. Jaishankar personally.

The Minister said Dr.Jaishankar’s visit was particularly significant as it coincided with the announcement of a further Indian relief and reconstruction package to support Sri Lanka’s recovery and rebuilding efforts, which he described as yet another demonstration of India’s enduring friendship and solidarity.

Herath recalled that India had extended “unprecedented assistance amounting to $ 4 billion” to Sri Lanka during its recent economic crisis through lines of credit for essential goods and petroleum, bilateral currency support and liability deferments.

He said Sri Lanka and India shared a long-standing, multi-dimensional relationship rooted in geographic proximity, deep historical and cultural ties, shared values and expanding economic linkages, adding that bilateral relations had continued to strengthen through regular high-level engagements and close political, official and people-to-people cooperation.

The Minister said Sri Lanka deeply valued India’s continued role in stabilising the economy, including emergency financing and foreign exchange support, as well as the settlement of payments amounting to $ 20.66 million for projects completed under existing Indian lines of credit.

He also acknowledged India’s “crucial role” in Sri Lanka’s external debt restructuring process, including its position as co-chair of the Official Creditors’ Committee (OCC), which helped facilitate the timely conclusion of negotiations.

Herath noted that earlier in the day Dr. Jaishankar had called on President Dissanayake, with bilateral discussions focusing on the broad trajectory of India–Sri Lanka cooperation across sectors such as economic development, energy security, connectivity, trade and investment, health, education, maritime security, digital cooperation, tourism and people-to-people exchanges.

The two sides also exchanged views on strengthening disaster preparedness and resilience in light of the increasing frequency and intensity of climate-related events in the region.

He said President Dissanayake had conveyed his sincere appreciation for India’s “swift and comprehensive humanitarian support”, including large-scale relief supplies, emergency medical assistance, search and rescue operations, the restoration of connectivity and support for rebuilding critical infrastructure. “This timely intervention has brought much-needed relief to affected communities and has been invaluable to Sri Lanka’s national response efforts,” Herath said.

According to the Minister, India provided more than 10,000 tons of relief material that was promptly distributed among affected communities, while an Indian Army field hospital established in Mahiyanganaya delivered critical healthcare services. Indian technical teams also helped restore connectivity disrupted by the cyclone, and around 10 tons of urgent medicines were supplied, strengthening Sri Lanka’s emergency healthcare response at a crucial time.

Herath further acknowledged India’s provision of 228 tons of Bailey bridge units in four batches, following a request by President Dissanayake to Prime Minister Modi, which enabled the rapid restoration of vital transport links.

He noted that Dr. Jaishankar had earlier in the day virtually inaugurated the Bailey Bridge installed in Kilinochchi in the presence of the President, calling it an important contribution to restoring connectivity.

Herath said Sri Lanka’s tourism sector had rebounded following the cyclone, with key attractions now fully operational. He noted that India remained Sri Lanka’s largest source of tourists and said a positive message from Dr. Jaishankar would further boost confidence and encourage continued visits.
