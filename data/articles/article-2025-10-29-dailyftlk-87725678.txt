Daraz Sri Lanka and Industry Ministry join to empower SMEs growth

Daraz Sri Lanka, in partnership with Industry Ministry and Entrepreneurship Development, conducted a specialised training session under the National Relationship Officer (RO) Program. The initiative, led by the Industry Ministry, aims to enhance the skills of field-level development officers, enabling them to provide stronger, more practical support to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

The training session, designed and delivered by Daraz Sri Lanka, focused on equipping Relationship Officers with the knowledge and tools to guide SMEs in building their online presence and reaching customers across the country. By sharing insights on digital platforms and e-commerce, the session enabled ROs to help SMEs expand their businesses beyond their local communities and create new opportunities for growth.

The first batch of RO training took place at the Sri Lanka Institute of Management (SLIM) in Colombo, with 53 field officers participating from different parts of the island. This program is part of the National SME Development Strategic Framework, which transforms Development Officers into Relationship Officers, ensuring they can provide more informed and holistic support to entrepreneurs.

“Our partnership with the Ministry of Industry reflects a shared vision of empowering Sri Lanka’s entrepreneurs to thrive in the digital era,” said Daraz Sri Lanka Chief Commercial Officer Praveen Rukshan. “Small and medium enterprises form the backbone of our economy and carry with them the hopes of families and communities across the island. By equipping Relationship Officers with the skills to guide SMEs online, we are hoping to create a network of trusted advisors who can help businesses embrace digital tools, expand their reach, and strengthen their resilience. This program is designed to give SMEs the confidence and capability to compete on a larger stage and contribute even more to national progress. At Daraz, we believe that every SME success story adds to the collective strength of our country, and we are committed to supporting that journey.”

“Through this program, we are not only sharing technical know-how but also helping Relationship Officers understand the practical challenges SMEs face every day,” added Daraz Sri Lanka Business Development and Engagement Manager Dhanushka Chathuranga. “For many small businesses, the journey to digital adoption can feel overwhelming. By working closely with ROs, we are ensuring that SMEs receive guidance that is both accessible and actionable, so they can take the first steps confidently and see tangible results.”

The collaboration reflects Daraz’s ongoing commitment to SME empowerment and digital inclusion. As Sri Lanka’s largest e-commerce platform, Daraz continues to play a key role in enabling entrepreneurs, from home-based sellers to growing local brands, to thrive online through training, technology, and wider market access.

In coming months, Daraz Sri Lanka will continue to work closely with the Government and institutional partners to build a stronger entrepreneurial ecosystem in Sri Lanka and drive inclusive economic growth for SMEs.
