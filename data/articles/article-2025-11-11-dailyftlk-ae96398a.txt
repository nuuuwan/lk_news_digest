PM says age-appropriate sex education is to protect children from sexual abuse

Highlights significant rise in incidents of child sexual abuse and need to provide children with proper knowledge and awareness to safeguard themselves

Assures sex education curriculum will be formed based on advice of experts

Notes NCPA flags child sexual abuse as serious concern in country

Prime Minister and Education Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya yesterday said discussions are underway to introduce an age-appropriate sex education program in schools with the aim of protecting children from sexual abuse.

Her remarks come in response to concerns raised by Archbishop of Colombo Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith, who described the proposed program as an “inappropriate sexual education initiative” planned for inclusion in next year’s school curriculum.

Speaking at an event, Dr. Amarasuriya pointed that there is a significant rise in incidents of child sexual abuse in the country, highlighting the requirement to provide children with proper knowledge and awareness to safeguard themselves.

She assured the sex education curriculum will be formed based on the advice of experts, especially those from the Health Sector.

“The Health Ministry, the Family Health Bureau, and the National Child Protection Authority (NCPA) have all recommended that sex education be introduced in the school curriculum. We have already introduced a health module for Grade 6 students, which focuses on maintaining good health. Specialists from the Family Health Bureau have proposed including sex education within this module to teach children how to protect their bodies,” she said.

She stressed that the NCPA has also pointed out that child sexual abuse remains a serious concern in the country and that educating children about their physical safety is crucial.

Dr. Amarasuriya also said that the Education Ministry is holding ongoing discussions with the Health Ministry and the NCPA, adding that both institutions have submitted their recommendations on how the program should be structured and implemented.
