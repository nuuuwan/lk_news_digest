NMSJ calls on Govt. to strengthen Information Commission than amending RTI Act

The National Movement for Social Justice (NMSJ) has urged the Government not to amend the Right to Information (RTI) Act but to resolve operational difficulties that the Information Commission is already facing.

In a press statement signed by its General Secretary Sunil Jayasekara, it highlighted lack of resources and fulfilling some of the vacant posts of the Commission as urgent requirements that needed to be looked into for the smooth functioning of the Commission.

It also stated that the Commission’s reputation has been underestimated by certain Government departments as they have failed to provide information on matters of public interest.

“This is not a good trend. The Government should appreciate the support received through the RTI Commission for the anti-corruption process,” Jayasekara stated.

The NMSJ stated that the Government should be concerned about those issues and it is hopeful that the Government will take prompt action to ensure that the Commission is adequately empowered.
