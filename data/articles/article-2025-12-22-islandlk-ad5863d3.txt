Colombo Bourse erases early gains as Dockyard plunges and IMF loan concerns dampen sentiment

The Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) saw early optimism quickly evaporate yesterday, closing in negative territory as investor sentiment was hit by a perfect storm of company-specific woes and macroeconomic concerns. The market’s retreat was primarily fueled by a continued slide in shares of Colombo Dockyard PLC and rising apprehension over Sri Lanka’s debt obligations following a new USD 200 million IMF emergency loan.

Trading activity, which opened on a positive note, turned decisively as Colombo Dockyard’s stock already in a severe downtrend remained a focal point of investor anxiety. Its decline is linked to the ongoing mechanics of a strategic rights issue for a takeover by India’s Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders. Simultaneously, news of the International Monetary Fund’s rapid financial instrument for climate-related disaster relief, while addressing urgent needs, inadvertently sparked investor fears about the nation’s escalating debt stock, further cooling market participation and pulling indices lower.

Amid those developments both indices moved downward. All Share Price Index down by 229.09 points while S and P SL20 down by 30.95 points. Turnover stood at Rs 2.98 billion with six crossings.

Those crossings were reported in Hemas Holdings, which crossed 10 million shares to the tune of Rs 340 million and its share price traded at Rs 34, JKH 3.1 million shares crossed to the tune of Rs 65.5 million and its share price traded at Rs 21, Tokyo Cement 398,000 shares crossed to the tune of Rs 44.9 million and its share price traded at Rs 112, Melstacorp 108,000 shares crossed to the tune of Rs 30.4 million and its share price traded at Rs 169, NTB 100,000 shares crossed to the tune of Rs 30 million and its share price traded at Rs 300 and Royal Ceramics 500,000 shares crossed to the tune of Rs 22.5 million and its share price traded at Rs 45.

In the retail market top seven companies that have mainly contributed to the turnover were Colombo Dockyard Rs 480 million (8.56 million shares traded), Tokyo Cement Rs 151 million (1.3 million shares traded), Colombo Dockyards Rs 131 million (1.2 million shares traded), Hemas Holdings Rs 93.5 million (2.7 million shares traded), JKH Rs 87.1 million (4.1 million shares traded), Capital Alliance Rs 72 million (1.1 million shares traded) and Tokyo Cement (Non-Voting) Rs 70 million (750,000 shares traded). During the day 81.9 million shares volumes changed hands in 26497 transactions.
