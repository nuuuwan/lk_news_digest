US Ambassador to Sri Lanka Julie Chung held a discussion on Sri Lanka’s National Research and Development Policy and other matters with President’s Senior Adviser on Science and Technology Prof. Gomika Udugamasooriya recently.

According to the President’s Media Division, the meeting at the US Embassy in Colombo focused on the relief measures for communities affected by Cyclone Ditwah and the broader “Rebuilding Sri Lanka” program, as well as the forthcoming National Research and Development Policy. Attention was also drawn to potential areas in which both countries could collaborate in implementing these initiatives.

The two sides also exchanged views on measures to attract greater US investment to Sri Lanka.

In addition, the discussion explored opportunities to enhance cooperation in emerging fields such as higher education, information technology, artificial intelligence (AI) and digitalisation under the National Research and Development Policy.

Ambassador Julie Chung noted that strengthening Sri Lanka’s research and development areas could open new pathways for Sri Lankan products and innovations to enter the US market. She also reaffirmed the United States’ support for enhancing technological and scientific cooperation between the two countries.
