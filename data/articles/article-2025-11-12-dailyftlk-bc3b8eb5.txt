WCIC happy with SME, women entrepreneur focus in Budget 2026

The Women’s Chamber of Industry and Commerce (WCIC) has described the 2026 Budget as a positive step for women-owned small and medium enterprises (SMEs), citing its focus on SME growth and specific allocations for women entrepreneurs.

“The 2026 Budget offers a positive signal for women-owned SMEs, especially through its SME focus and explicit mention of women entrepreneur allocations,” the Chamber said in a statement issued yesterday.

However, it cautioned that the success of these measures would depend on how effectively the programs reach women entrepreneurs and address structural barriers such as access to finance, formalisation, childcare and family demands, and market access.

WCIC commended the Government’s decision to strengthen the start-up ecosystem and make QR code payments under Rs. 5,000 free of charge, calling it a positive step for SMEs.

The Chamber further welcomed the move to consolidate the National Enterprise Development Authority (NEDA) and the Small and Medium Enterprise Development Division (SMED) under the Industrial Development Board (IDB), describing it as a welcome move to provide an efficient service under one roof for industries with a better focus.

WCIC noted that some Budget proposals may present challenges for small enterprises.

“While the lowering of the VAT threshold will help broaden the tax base, it may also pose challenges for small businesses that are already operating on thin margins,” the Chamber said.

“The proposed minimum wage increase, though beneficial to workers, could create additional financial pressure for employers, particularly within the SME sector,” it added.

WCIC said it’s committed to work with policymakers and stakeholders to ensure that the design of the Budget’s support measures work for women entrepreneurs and women in business across the country.
