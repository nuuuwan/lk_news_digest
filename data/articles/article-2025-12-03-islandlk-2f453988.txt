Combinations to slow down skin ageing

Last week I did mention that I would work out some combinations to help you slow down skin ageing.

You will need the white of 01egg, 01 teaspoon lemon juice and 01 teaspoon honey.

Whisk the egg white with the lemon juice and honey until frothy, and then apply the mixture evenly to your cleansed face. Leave it for 15-20 minutes before rinsing with lukewarm water.

After rinsing, follow up with a moisturiser to lock in hydration and support enhanced elasticity.

Use it 02-03 times a week for optimal tightening and oil control.

(Egg whites are a popular natural remedy for anti-ageing as they help tighten and tone the skin. Their high protein content works to shrink pores and control excess oil, leading to reduced fine lines and a firmer texture.)

You will need 01 ripe banana, 01 tablespoon honey and 01 teaspoon lemon juice.

Mash the banana until smooth and mix in the honey and lemon juice. Apply the paste evenly on your face and leave it for 15-20 minutes and then rinse with lukewarm water.

Apply it 02-03 times a week to maintain hydration and promote a youthful glow.

(Bananas are rich in vitamins and antioxidants that deeply moisturise the skin, boost elasticity, and help minimise wrinkles. This mask acts as an excellent at-home anti-ageing treatment for rejuvenating tired skin.)

You will need 01 ripe avocado, 01 tablespoon honey and 01 tablespoon yoghurt

Mash the avocado until smooth, then mix in the honey and yoghurt and apply the paste to your face and let it sit for 15-20 minutes before rinsing off with lukewarm water.

Use 02-03 times a week to consistently replenish moisture and nutrients.

(Avocado is a nutrient powerhouse, offering healthy fats, vitamins, and antioxidants. It deeply nourishes, hydrates, and improves skin elasticity, making it a standout natural remedy for anti-ageing.)

You will need 01teaspoon turmeric powder, 01 teaspoon honey and 01 tablespoon yoghurt.

In a bowl, mix the turmeric powder with the yoghurt and honey and apply the mixture to your face and leave it on for 10-15 minutes and then rinse off with lukewarm water.

Use it 01-02 times per week to avoid irritation while still reaping the brightening benefits.

(Turmeric is renowned for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. It brightens the skin, reduces dark spots, and smooths out uneven texture, making it an ideal anti-ageing home remedy.)

* Always perform a patch test before use, as turmeric can stain the skin. Rinse thoroughly to ensure no residue remains.

You will need 1/2 (half) cucumber and 01 tablespoon yoghurt.

Blend the cucumber into a smooth paste and mix it with the yoghurt and apply the mixture to your face and leave it on for 15-20 minutes, and then rinse with lukewarm water.

Use it 02-03 times a week to keep your skin cool, hydrated, and refreshed.

Chill the mask in the refrigerator for a more invigorating, pore-tightening effect.

(Cucumber’s high water content and natural enzymes make it an excellent remedy for hydrating and tightening ageing skin. It helps reduce puffiness and minimises the appearance of wrinkles.)
