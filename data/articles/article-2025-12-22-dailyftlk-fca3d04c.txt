National Lottery Board set to exceed 2025 revenue target by Rs. 8 b

The National Lottery Board is on track to generate an additional Rs. 8 billion in revenue this year, comfortably surpassing the target set for 2025, Economic Development Deputy Minister Nishantha Jayaweera said yesterday.

Speaking at a ceremony held at the Finance Ministry to present cheques to lottery winners, the Deputy Minister said the Board had already achieved its original revenue target of Rs. 40 billion by the end of October.

Following this milestone, a further target of Rs. 6.5 billion was assigned, which has also been fully met.

He added that the Board is expected to raise another Rs. 1.5 billion before the end of the year, bringing the total excess revenue generation to around Rs. 8 billion above the initial target.

Jayaweera noted that the performance of the National Lottery Board reflects improved operational efficiency and strong public participation, underscoring the institution’s growing contribution to State revenue at a time of continued fiscal consolidation.

At the event, six lottery winners were presented with their cheques, including the winner of the Rs. 130 million super prize from the Dhana Nidhana lottery. The National Lottery Board disbursed a total of Rs. 276 million in prize money on this occasion.

In addition to prize payouts, a significant portion of lottery proceeds was transferred to the Government Consolidated Fund. An additional contribution of Rs. 750 million from lottery revenues earned in 2025, together with Rs. 515 million from November revenues, amounting to a total of Rs. 1.265 billion, was formally handed over during the ceremony.

Treasury Secretary Dr. Harshana Suriyapperuma, National Lottery Board Chairman M.D.C.A. Perera, General Manager A.M. Arif, and several senior officials were present at the event.

Officials said the strong revenue performance of the National Lottery Board continues to play an important role in supporting Government finances, while also enabling timely prize payments and regular transfers to the Consolidated Fund.
