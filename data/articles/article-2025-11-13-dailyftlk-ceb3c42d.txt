SLPP and UNP hold talks ahead of anti-Govt. rally

Key leaders of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) and the United National Party (UNP) met yesterday to discuss coordination and participation for the Opposition-led protest rally scheduled for 21 November in Nugegoda.

The rally is aimed at holding the National People’s Power (NPP)-led Government accountable and urging it to fulfill its election promises.

The meeting, held at former President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s party office in Flower Road, focused on the objectives of the rally, expected public participation, and the coordination among opposition parties.

Following the meeting, speaking to the media, SLPP MP Namal Rajapaksa said the rally is intended to remind the Government of its commitments to the people and address grievances arising from policies. “Several opposition parties are participating in the discussions. In the past, discussions were held only within the SLPP, but today we met with the UNP to ensure the success of the rally,” he said.

Rajapaksa added that the event will serve as a platform for citizens affected by government policies to express their concerns. “Many people affected by government policies will join the rally,” he noted.

The SLFP and UNP have confirmed their participation, while other opposition parties are expected to announce their involvement following internal consultations. The rally is anticipated to be one of the major opposition-led demonstrations in recent months.
