In the current global context, it is essential that the Government and private sector organizations such as the CNCI work together to strengthen local industries – PM

Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya made these remarks while addressing the “CNCI Achiever Awards 2025” held on 23 October at the Cinnamon Life Hotel, Colombo. The annual ceremony, organized by the Ceylon National Chamber of Industries (CNCI) in collaboration with the Ministry of Industry and Entrepreneurship Development, aims to recognize and encourage outstanding contributions within Sri Lanka’s industrial sector.

In her address, the Prime Minister underscored that the strength of the country’s industries directly determines its ability to create jobs, reduce imports, and ensure sustainable economic growth.

“Support should focus on building capacity, encouraging innovation, facilitating expansion, and improving access to new markets. A resilient and competitive industrial base is not only an economic priority, it is a national necessity,” she noted.

The Prime Minister further emphasized the Government’s responsibility to create an enabling environment for industrial growth by expanding access to finance, technology, and skills development.

In  her speech Dr. Amarasuriya also highlighted the importance of women’s participation in the industrial sector, stressing that gender inclusivity is both a matter of fairness and an economic strategy.

“The success of local entrepreneurs ultimately strengthens the foundation of our national economy. Women play a significant role in production, management, innovation, and design, yet their contributions often remain under-recognized. Increasing women’s participation whether as workers, managers, or entrepreneurs strengthens the entire industrial ecosystem through higher productivity and innovation,” she further stated.

The Prime Minister reaffirmed that under the National People’s Power (NPP) Government, measures are being implemented to advance women’s economic participation through policy reforms and institutional support. She outlined ongoing initiatives, including improved access to credit and financial services, vocational and technical training, equal pay for equal work, and support for women-led enterprises.

“We are committed to addressing barriers such as unpaid care responsibilities that limit women’s participation in the workforce and to strengthening gender-responsive industrial policies that promote inclusive growth,” she added. The Prime Minister also acknowledged the role of entrepreneurs in national development, noting that their creativity and determination are essential drivers of progress.”

During the ceremony, Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya presented two Crystal Awards to Haycarb PLC and Matara Freelan Enterprises (Pvt) Ltd, as well as the Top 10 Achiever Awards to outstanding industrial performers.

The event was attended by Minister of Industries and Entrepreneurship Development  Sunil Hadunneththi, Deputy Minister  Chathuranga Abeysinghe, Chairman of CNCI   Pradeep Kahawalage, and other distinguished guests.
