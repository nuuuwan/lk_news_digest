A review of Sri Lanka’s genetic inheritance challenge

The recent findings on consanguinity rates in Sri Lanka by Dr. Thurairajah’s team, as reported in The Sunday Times, have brought a long-standing but often private practice into the public health discourse. With a national average of 7% and rates approaching 25% among Tamil communities, Sri Lanka presents a compelling case for a comparative global analysis. But how does Sri Lanka’s experience fit into the global picture? What can we learn from nations that have confronted similar challenges, some successfully, others less so? This investigation takes Dr. Thurairajah’s findings as a starting point for a broader exploration.

Sri Lanka stands at a crossroads. Will it learn from international successes and act proactively, or will it wait, as Britain did, until the problem demands belated, reactive intervention? The evidence from around the world suggests that the answer to this question will be measured not in policy documents, but in the health of children not yet born.

Consanguineous marriage, unions between blood relatives, is far more common, worldwide, than most people realise. According to research published in Reproductive Health, approximately 10.4% of the global population lives in consanguineous unions, affecting over 1.1 billion people. The practice is not confined to any single region, religion, or economic status.

The highest rates appear in North Africa, the Middle East, and West Asia, where consanguinity rates can exceed 50% in some communities. Pakistan reports rates between 50-60%, while several Middle Eastern countries show similar figures. Even in Europe, immigrant communities from high-consanguinity regions maintain the practice at significant levels. Bradford, England, for instance, has documented that 37% of Pakistani-origin marriages are between first cousins.

Sri Lanka’s 7% national average actually places it on the lower end of the global spectrum, though the 25% rate among Tamil communities aligns more closely with patterns seen in South India, where cousin marriage has deep cultural roots, stretching back centuries.

The biological risks Dr. Thurairajah describes are well-established in medical literature. When first cousins marry, they share approximately 12.5% of their genes. This shared genetic heritage doubles the baseline risk of autosomal recessive disorders, conditions that require inheriting a faulty gene from both parents.

Research published in The Lancet, by Hamamy and colleagues, confirm that first-cousin unions increase the risk of congenital malformations, intellectual disability, and early mortality. The absolute risk increase is modest, from about 3-4% in the general population to 6-8% in first-cousin marriages, but in communities where the practice continues across multiple generations, recessive genes concentrate, amplifying risks significantly.

Cyprus offers perhaps the most instructive case study for Sri Lanka. In the 1970s, thalassemia was devastating Cypriot families, with approximately one in 158 births affected by the severe form. The economic burden was crushing, and the human cost immeasurable.

Rather than ban cousin marriage, a practice embedded in village life, the Cypriot Orthodox Church and government collaborated on a revolutionary approach. Beginning in 1983, the Church made premarital thalassemia screening mandatory for couples seeking religious marriage. The programme combined testing with counselling, giving couples information and choices rather than prohibitions.

The results were dramatic. Within two decades, the birth prevalence of thalassemia dropped by over 95%. The programme succeeded because it respected cultural autonomy while providing the tools for informed decision-making. Couples who discovered they were both carriers could choose to marry anyway, adopt, use prenatal diagnosis, or seek partners elsewhere. Most importantly, no one was stigmatised, the programme was universal, not targeted.

The United Kingdom presents a more troubling case study, one that demonstrates the perils of cultural relativism taken too far. Despite evidence that British Pakistani communities had significantly elevated rates of infant mortality and genetic disorders linked to consanguinity, public health authorities remained largely silent for decades, fearing accusations of racism.

Research published in Human Heredity found that British Pakistani infants had a 10-fold higher risk of recessive genetic disorders compared to the general population. Yet even as pediatric genetic services struggled with overwhelming caseloads, authorities hesitated to address the elephant in the consulting room.

The financial argument for genetic screening becomes compelling when examined through economic research. A study analyzed the cost-effectiveness of premarital screening programmes for thalassemia and found that every dollar spent on screening and counselling saved between five and ten dollars in lifetime treatment costs.

For Sri Lanka, with over 2,000 children requiring lifelong thalassemia treatment, the arithmetic is sobering. Each patient requires blood transfusions every two-four weeks, iron chelation therapy, and management of complications, an annual cost estimated at several hundred thousand rupees per patient. Scaling this across thousands of patients over their lifetimes creates an enormous burden on both families and the healthcare system.

Prevention through screening costs a tiny fraction of treatment costs. The genetic test for thalassemia carrier status costs approximately 2,000-3,000 rupees. Even adding genetic counselling, the total investment per couple would likely be under 10,000 rupees, a sum quickly recovered through prevented disease.

While thalassemia provides a clear, measurable outcome, research suggests it represents only the most visible consequence of sustained consanguinity. Studies from consanguineous populations worldwide document elevated rates of congenital heart defects, hearing loss, blindness, metabolic disorders, and intellectual disabilities.

A comprehensive review noted that first-cousin unions are associated with a 1.7 to 2.8 percentage point increase in childhood mortality rates. While this might seem modest at the individual level, multiplied across thousands of births annually, it represents hundreds of preventable child deaths.

Moreover, the health impacts extend beyond childhood. Research from Qatar, where consanguinity rates exceed 50%, has identified increased risks of complex adult-onset conditions including diabetes, hypertension, and certain cancers in populations with high levels of consanguineous marriage across generations.

Given global evidence, what path forward makes sense for Sri Lanka?

emerges as the gold standard. Making genetic screening available, and ideally normative, for all couples, regardless of their relationship, removes stigma while providing crucial information. The Cypriot model of Church involvement might translate in Sri Lanka to engagement with Buddhist Temples, Hindu Kovils, and Mosques.

should begin in secondary school, integrated into biology curricula. Students should learn basic Mendelian genetics not as abstract science but as practical life knowledge, understanding carrier status, inheritance patterns, and reproductive choices.

within high-prevalence communities should be identified and supported. Young couples who voluntarily undergo testing, or families who have faced genetic disease and now advocate for screening, can shift norms far more effectively than external authorities.

Sri Lanka’s “quiet genetic problem” is neither a crisis, demanding immediate drastic action, nor a trivial concern to be ignored. It is, rather, a public health challenge that demands what public health does best: combining rigorous science with cultural sensitivity, replacing silence with information, and trusting communities to make wise choices when given the tools to do so.

The global evidence is clear: prohibition fails, education succeeds. Stigma harms screening helps. Coercion backfires, compassion works. Dr. Thurairajah and his colleagues have opened an important conversation. The question now is whether Sri Lanka will learn from the successes of Cyprus and Sardinia or repeat the mistakes of delayed action seen elsewhere.

Children who will be born healthy because of informed choices their parents made, children who will never need a transfusion, never face shortened lives, will be the true measure of success. They will also be invisible, their health unremarked because illness was quietly prevented.
