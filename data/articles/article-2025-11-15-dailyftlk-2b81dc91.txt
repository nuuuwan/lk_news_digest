Opposition petitions Govt. to withdraw Praja Shakthi circular, cites political motives

Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa criticises Praja Shakthi as a political tool allegedly used by Govt. to expand JVP influence over grassroots structures

Alleges misuse of State mechanisms, claiming funding is insufficient for poverty alleviation while public tax burdens rise

Claims authority is shifting from elected representatives to JVP-aligned cadres, centralising control over village committees and youth groups

Warns of a “constitutional authoritarian model,” threatening democratic space and representation under President AKD

A total of 27 Opposition MPs have signed a petition urging the Government to immediately withdraw the circular issued in connection with the Praja Shakthi program.

Speaking at a joint media briefing yesterday, Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa accused the Government of using the initiative as a political tool to expand what he described as JVP-led control over grassroots structures. He claimed that while the Government promotes Praja Shakthi as a poverty alleviation and village development programme, the funding allocated is insufficient to achieve these objectives.

Instead, he alleged, the Government is imposing higher tax burdens on the public while diverting State mechanisms to strengthen the JVP’s organisational network.

Premadasa said the program effectively transfers authority from elected representatives to JVP-aligned grassroots cadres, allowing the party to influence Grama Niladhari divisions and local community structures from its headquarters, bypassing democratic accountability. He further warned that youth groups, civil security committees, and legally registered community organisations are gradually being placed under a single centralised structure aligned with the JVP, and even caste-based committee compositions could soon fall under political influence.

Describing the initiative as an emerging “constitutional authoritarian model” led by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, Premadasa argued that it threatens democratic space and public representation.

He emphasised that the Opposition firmly rejects the program in its current form and is prepared to unite to restructure Praja Shakthi as an inclusive initiative that empowers all communities irrespective of ethnicity, religion, caste, or political affiliation.

The press briefing was attended by Sarvajana Balaya leader MP Dilith Jayaweera, SJB MP Dayasiri Jayasekara, New Democratic Front (NDF) MP Rohitha Abeygunawardena, Independent Group MP Dr. Ramanathan Archchuna, and other Opposition representatives
