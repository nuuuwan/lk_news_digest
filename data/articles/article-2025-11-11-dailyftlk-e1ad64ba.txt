GEW 2025 mobilises Sri Lankan innovators under banner ‘Together We Build’

Sri Lanka is set to celebrate Global Entrepreneurship Week (GEW) 2025 from 17 to 23 November, continuing to lead the region in entrepreneurial ecosystem development. Building on three consecutive years of impactful programing and the foundation laid during GEW 2024, the Information Communication Technology Agency (ICTA) has once again been appointed by the Global Entrepreneurship Network (GEN) as the national host.

ICTA, operating under the Digital Economy Ministry, will lead this year’s initiative with a renewed commitment to empower the country’s entrepreneurial ecosystem. The 2025 celebration promises to be more inclusive, impactful and far-reaching.

Global Entrepreneurship Week is the world’s largest celebration of innovators and entrepreneurs driving economic growth and social progress. This year’s theme, ‘Together We Build’, reflects the collective power of collaboration among the Government, industry, academia and civil society to shape a resilient and inclusive entrepreneurial future. It underscores the importance of shared responsibility in nurturing innovation, expanding opportunity and fostering sustainable growth.

The official launch of GEW 2025 will take place on 14 November at Temple Trees, Colombo, from 8.30 a.m. to 11.30 a.m., with Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya as the Chief Guest. Alongside the main ceremony, parallel events will be held across all nine provinces, marking a nationwide start to Global Entrepreneurship Week Sri Lanka.

GEW 2025 will feature a dynamic program of workshops, boot camps, mentoring sessions, forums and networking events in all nine provinces. Each district will be supported by a dedicated five-member coordination panel to ensure inclusive participation and grassroots engagement. The initiative will focus on empowering youth, women and underserved communities, while promoting sustainable technology adoption, digital literacy and regional innovation.

This year’s celebration aims to deepen outreach and expand impact. While last year’s theme, ‘Entrepreneurship is for Everyone’, laid the groundwork for inclusive engagement, GEW 2025 moves further by fostering collaboration and co-creation. The focus extends beyond individual entrepreneurial journeys to shared infrastructure, networks and partnerships that enable long-term success.

ICTA and its partners will collaborate with universities, corporates, ecosystem organisations and district secretariats to deliver programing tailored to local needs. From emerging technologies and startup scaling to rural enterprise support and community-led innovation, GEW 2025 will showcase the diversity and potential of Sri Lanka’s entrepreneurial landscape.

As GEW 2025 approaches, Sri Lanka stands ready to ignite a new wave of innovation and collaboration. Under the theme ‘Together We Build’, the celebration seeks to inspire a national movement uniting the country’s dreamers, doers and changemakers to build a stronger, more resilient entrepreneurial future.
