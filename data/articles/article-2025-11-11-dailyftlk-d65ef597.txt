The 39th Annual Conference and Expo of the Confederation of Asia-Pacific Chambers of Commerce and Industry (CACCI) opened in Colombo yesterday, bringing together business leaders, policymakers, and entrepreneurs from 28 member nations under the theme “Entrepreneurship in the Asian Century”.

Hosted by the Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry of Sri Lanka (FCCISL), the two-day event at Cinnamon Life City of Dreams marked the first time Sri Lanka has hosted the regional business summit, which has been held annually since 1966.

CACCI is a regional organisation spanning 28 member countries, including Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and others across South and East Asia, Central Asia, and the Pacific.

As an umbrella network of national and regional chambers, CACCI works to strengthen private-sector collaboration across the Asia-Pacific, promoting trade, investment, and entrepreneurship. It serves as a platform for policy advocacy, training, and regional dialogue, complementing the work of its member chambers and helping businesses navigate globalisation.

Through its annual conferences, presidential visits, alliances with international institutions, and policy and research initiatives, CACCI positions itself as a steward of private enterprise, fostering cooperation among Asia-Pacific business leaders to drive sustainable and inclusive growth across the region.

CACCI brings together national chambers across Asia-Pacific, representing nearly three billion people and a combined GDP of approximately $ 18-20 trillion, positioning it as one of the largest regional private-sector networks in the region.

In his welcome address, FCCISL President Keerthi Gunawardane said the 21st century truly belongs to Asia, home to more than 60% of the world’s population and now contributing a similar share of global GDP.

“What drives this growth most powerfully is the entrepreneurial energy of our people, the small business owners, startup founders, and visionary enterprise leaders who are shaping industries and communities,” he said.

Gunawardane noted that Sri Lanka, situated at the crossroads of East and West, is well positioned to play a catalytic role in connecting regional markets and ideas.

“The conference provides an extraordinary platform to connect, collaborate and create, connecting nations through commerce, collaborating on new technologies, sustainable solutions, and creating opportunities for inclusive growth,” he said.

Speaking to the Daily FT at the side lines of the event, Gunawardane said hosting the annual CACCI conference was great opportunity to showcase what Sri Lanka has to offer and build collaborations across the region. “Such events can help local businesses build networks, explore new opportunities and brain-storm common challenges,” he said.

One such challenge was the absence of clear trade policy and capacity to negotiate bi-lateral and regional trade pacts to give Sri Lankan businesses access to bigger, lucrative markets in the region. Private sector initiatives such as this is the next best alternative.

Commenting on Sri Lanka’s trade outlook, Gunawardane stressed the need for a clear and pragmatic trade policy before signing bilateral or regional free trade agreements. “We often sign FTAs without proper study. We must identify sectors we can sustain and strengthen before entering such deals,” he said.

CACCI President Peter McMullin AM said the organisation’s founding principle that businesspeople should act as “merchants of peace” remained deeply relevant amid geopolitical uncertainty.

“This century belongs to the Asian communities,” he said. “We approach challenges as entrepreneurs, and we can resolve these issues by working together rather than sitting on our hands.”

McMullin noted that CACCI’s work since 1966 has focused on connecting Asia-Pacific economies through conferences, trade missions, and policy dialogue to strengthen collaboration and trust across the region.

The first day of the conference featured six sectoral plenary sessions focusing on key areas of regional growth and resilience.
