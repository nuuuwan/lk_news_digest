Truth and Reconciliation Bill soon, PC elections next year

Foreign Affairs Minister Vijitha Herath told Parliament yesterday a Bill to establish a Truth and Reconciliation Commission will be presented soon, while preparations were underway to hold Provincial Council elections next year.

He said discussions will be held to determine the electoral framework, noting that a decision would be made on whether to conduct the polls under the proportional representation system or a mixed model.

The Minister also said new legislation to replace the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) is being finalised.

“Sri Lanka’s human rights issue had already been internationalised and made more complex by the time this Government took office in 2024,” Herath noted.
