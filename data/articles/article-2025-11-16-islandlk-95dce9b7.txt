Marigold Creation blossoms in Avissawella: A new sanctuary for learning, Art and community

Avissawella’s quiet lanes, brushed by the cool breath of the Wet Zone Botanic Garden, witnessed a new kind of flowering recently — one not of petals, but of people, stories and ideas. Marigold Creation, a multidisciplinary educational and creative centre, opened its doors with an intimate artist talk that set the tone for what promises to be one of the region’s most transformative community hubs.

The space — part gallery, part studio, part learning centre — was inaugurated with a deeply reflective conversation featuring celebrated poet Ajana Ranagala, whose lyrical work Ape Aha Koheda Lily Mal framed the afternoon in tenderness and introspection. The crowd, a mix of students, academics, artists and villagers, gathered not just to listen, but to take part in a dialogue that roamed freely across poetry, memory, language, identity and the quiet urgencies of life.

For Waruni Anuruddhika Chandrasena, the founder of Marigold Creation, the event was a dream come true at its first sunrise. A filmmaker, researcher and multimedia lecturer with years of work in peacebuilding, visual culture and community empowerment, she describes Marigold Creation as “a seed nurtured over many years — shaped by people, place and purpose.”

“This space is rooted in the idea of an ecology of education,” Waruni told The Island.

“Education is not a one-way transmission. It breathes. It grows through relationships — between the learner and the community, between art and environment, between personal histories and shared knowledge.”

At Marigold Creation, this philosophy is not theory but practice. The centre houses a creative studio, gallery, vocational training spaces and a community hub, each designed to encourage reciprocal learning. The approach is both holistic and humble: to draw knowledge from the community, feed it back into the community, and allow creativity to become an everyday tool for empowerment.

During Saturday’s opening, this ethos unfolded gracefully. Ranagala’s session, titled “Ape Aha Koheda Lili Mal,” became more than a poetry reading — it turned into a collective meditation. Participants shared their reflections, questioned the intersections of language and belonging, and explored how literature can reveal what Waruni describes as “the unseen heartbeat of humanity.”

“Marigold Creation is a response to a need I’ve felt for years — a place where learning is context-driven, accessible and conscious of the world we live in. We want to create a space where art meets education, where nature shapes creativity, where local stories matter.”

The centre’s location itself is an extension of this philosophy. Tucked near the lush Wet Zone Botanic Garden, its environment offers a living classroom — a reminder that education extends beyond walls, into the rustle of leaves, the quiet curve of the river and the lived experiences of people who call the area home.

Waruni, whose work has spanned collaborations with institutions from Cornell University to the UNDP, says her vision is grounded as much in global insight as in local reality.

“I’ve worked across disciplines and countries, but I’ve always felt that meaningful transformation begins at home — in our villages, in our small towns, among people whose stories rarely enter mainstream narratives.”

Her ongoing research into photography, political journalism and identity feeds into Marigold Creation’s broader purpose: to foster critical dialogue, encourage creative expression and build a platform where emerging voices can find their footing.

The centre’s founding pillars — inclusive education, ecological awareness, creative empowerment and community collaboration — were visibly alive during the opening. Children lingered over artworks, university students debated literary metaphors, and elders from the area shared stories that bridged generations.

If the inaugural event is any indication, Marigold Creation is poised to become more than a learning centre. It is a gathering place for ideas; a meeting ground for art and social consciousness; a space where, as Waruni puts it, “learning is not an event but a continuous, evolving relationship.”

As the evening wound down, the marigold-coloured sky outside seemed to echo the sentiment inside — that something new had indeed begun to bloom in Avissawella. Not loudly, but gently. Not as a monument, but as a living, breathing ecosystem of creativity.

“We are only at the beginning,” Waruni said with a quiet smile.

“This is the first step in a collective journey — one that we hope will grow with every story shared, every class taught, every conversation sparked. Marigold Creation is for everyone. It belongs to the community.”

And if the warmth of its first gathering is any sign, the community is already embracing it — not just as a centre, but as a promise.
