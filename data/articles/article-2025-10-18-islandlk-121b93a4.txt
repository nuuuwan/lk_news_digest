Renewables Overtake Coal — A Turning Point for the Planet

At last, amidst a world distracted by conflicts, tariffs, and economic uncertainty, there is positive news that should lift every mind and heart: renewable energy has overtaken coal as the world’s leading source of electricity.

This historic first, presented in Ember’s Global Electricity Review 2025, launched today, October 7, marks the beginning of a new era in human progress — one lit by the clean power of the sun and the wind.

Based in London, Ember is an independent, non-profit energy think tank that tracks and analyses global electricity data to accelerate the transition from fossil fuels to clean power. The Global Electricity Review—covers electricity generation in over 200 countries.

Ember’s managing director, Phil MacDonald, captures the moment perfectly: “Cleantech, not fossil fuels, is now the driving force of economic development. The era of fossil growth is coming to an end, even in a world of fast-rising demand.”

In 2024, low-carbon power sources — renewables plus nuclear — supplied 40.9 percent of global electricity, the highest share since the 1940s. Fossil fuels, once unchallenged, fell below 60 percent of the mix for the first time in eight decades.

Together, solar and wind now produce 15 percent of the world’s electricity, surpassing hydropower for the first time. Solar generation has doubled in just three years, racing past 2,000 TWh — enough to power the whole of India.

China was responsible for over half of global solar growth in 2024, meeting 81 percent of its own rise in electricity demand with clean power. The country installed a record 277 gigawatts (GW) of solar capacity last year — more than triple its 2022 rate — and now generates 8.3 percent of its electricity from the sun.

India, too, is accelerating its clean-energy revolution. Its solar capacity additions doubled in 2024 compared with 2023, rising by 24 GW, and utility-scale projects now under construction are set to double India’s wind and solar capacity before 2028. Clean sources already meet a third of India’s new power demand; by 2030, they could supply three-quarters.

Together, China and India — once seen as engines of fossil growth — are now poised to tip the global balance toward declining fossil generation. According to Ember’s modelling, China’s fossil output could fall by more than 500 TWh by 2029, while India’s rise slows to less than half its previous pace. The age of unstoppable fossil expansion is ending.

The Ember Global Electricity Review 2025 highlights Pakistan as one of the fastest-rising new markets for solar energy. In 2024, the country experienced a dramatic surge in rooftop solar installations, driven by soaring electricity prices and dependence on costly fossil-fuel contracts. To meet this demand, Pakistan imported 17 GW of solar panels in 2024 — double the amount imported the year before — making it one of the world’s largest new markets for solar installations that year.

From Latin America comes equally stirring news. Brazil’s solar generation leapt 45 percent in 2024, adding 23 TWh after an even larger rise the previous year. Solar now provides 10 percent of Brazil’s electricity — up from barely 1 percent five years ago. This remarkable growth has vaulted Brazil into the world’s top five solar-generating nations, overtaking Germany and joining China and India among the new solar superpowers.

Chile has become another example of change: 22 percent of its electricity now comes from solar, compared with just eight percent in 2019.

Solar’s reach is widening fast across the African continent. Imports of solar panels to the region have tripled in two years. In 2024 alone, South Africa imported 3.8 GW, while Nigeria and Morocco each crossed the one-GW threshold for the first time. Rooftop solar has become the people’s solution to unreliable grids — cheap, fast, and transformative. What was once a continent left in the dark is beginning to harvest its boundless daylight.

The report shows that the plummeting cost of lithium-ion batteries — down 20 percent in 2024 to $115 per kWh, 84 percent cheaper than a decade ago — is now unlocking round-the-clock solar power. Global battery capacity nearly doubled last year to 69 GW.

California already meets almost a fifth of its evening electricity with stored solar energy, and the world’s first 24-hour solar project — a one-GW plant in Abu Dhabi — is on the way. The dream of continuous clean power is becoming reality.

While heatwaves briefly lifted fossil output in 2024, Ember’s analysis makes it clear: without those extreme temperatures, fossil generation would have barely risen 0.2 percent.

The signal beneath the noise is unmistakable — clean technology, not fossil fuel, is now the engine of economic development.

Even with electricity demand growing faster than ever — driven by electric vehicles, data centres, and heat pumps — clean energy is expanding quickly enough to meet and exceed it. If current trends continue, fossil generation will begin a structural decline before the decade’s end.

This is humanity’s first real pivot toward a cleaner, calmer future — proof that collective will and technological ingenuity can illuminate the path ahead. Amidst the storms of our time, the planet is turning its face toward the sun — and smiling.
