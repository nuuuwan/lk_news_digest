In a major step towards cultivating Sri Lanka’s next generation of tech talent, HUTCH has entered into a landmark Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Faculty of Computing (FoC), University of Sri Jayewardenepura (USJ), to provide undergraduates with hands-on exposure to real-world ICT operations, complementing their academic foundation with industry readiness.

Under this partnership, undergraduates specializing in IT will have access to practical training across critical domains such as ERP systems, network infrastructure, data analytics, and professional development. The initiative includes curated knowledge-sharing sessions led by HUTCH professionals, as well as guided visits to HUTCH data centers, giving students first-hand insight into enterprise-grade ICT environments and the strategic decision-making that sustains them.

This collaboration aligns with HUTCH’s broader vision of contributing to Sri Lanka’s digital advancement by empowering local talent with globally relevant skills. For USJ, the alliance reinforces its commitment to academic excellence by enabling students to translate theory into practice, gaining real-world exposure in parallel with classroom learning.

Speaking on the significance of the partnership, Mangala Bandara, General Manager – Corporate Affairs at HUTCH, said, “At HUTCH, we believe that the most valuable investment we can make is in people, and this collaboration with the University of Sri Jayewardenepura is a testament to that belief. By opening up our resources, infrastructure, and expertise to future graduates, we are not only contributing to their growth but also to the development of a smarter, more capable Sri Lanka.”

Prof. Pathmalal M. Manage, Vice Chancellor of the University of Sri Jayewardenepura, added: “This MoU represents a progressive step in how we deliver education in today’s evolving world. Our students will now benefit from direct industry interactions, making them more agile, informed, and employment-ready by the time they graduate.

This MoU establishes the foundation for a roadmap of joint initiatives. Both parties intend to expand the program into a sustained cycle of industry engagement, internships, and technology-led learning experiences positioning graduates to thrive in Sri Lanka’s growing digital economy.
