Sathosa says onion purchases not rejected based on size

Lanka Sathosa has clarified that it does not measure the size of big onions when buying directly from farmers, relying instead on visual inspection during the procurement process, officials said.

The State-run retailer recently launched a program to purchase big onions directly from farmers to ease difficulties in selling their produce. The procurement included 17 conditions, one of which specified that onion bulbs should range between 35mm and 65mm in diameter, with about eight bulbs per kilogram.

Some farmers raised concerns that their harvests did not meet these standards.

In response, Lanka Sathosa Quality Assurance Division Head Lahiru Samanga assured that no consignments had been rejected solely based on the size of the onions.

He noted that the buying process prioritises visual inspection rather than precise measurements, ensuring that farmers’ produce is accepted even if it does not perfectly conform to the stipulated size range.

The move is part of ongoing efforts to support local onion producers and stabilise supply for consumers.
