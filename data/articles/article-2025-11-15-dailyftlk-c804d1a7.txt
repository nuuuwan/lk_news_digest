Commercial Bank has rolled out its new agency banking network, ‘ComBank Shakthi,’ extending formal banking services to underserved communities and expanding the bank’s reach beyond major towns.

In a banking landscape where accessibility and customer convenience are increasingly important, the bank said its move into ComBank Shakthi represents a proactive response to customer needs in distant areas. The model allows the bank to partner with selected third-party agents, typically local businesses or individuals, who act as intermediaries between the bank and its customers, delivering core financial services without the need to establish fully-fledged branches.

Through these authorised agents, Commercial Bank customers will be able to perform essential transactions such as cash deposits, withdrawals, fund transfers, and bill payments at convenient and accessible locations, especially in rural and underserved areas. This facility provides significant convenience by reducing the time and cost customers spend traveling to the nearest branch to meet their financial needs.

The introduction of ComBank Shakthi marks a new chapter in Commercial Bank’s growth and service delivery strategy, reinforcing its position as a customer-focused and inclusive financial institution that continues to evolve with the needs of communities across the nation.

Commercial Bank said its ComBank Shakthi Agency Banking operations are closely integrated with the activities of its Agriculture and Micro Finance Units (AMFU), leveraging the trusted relationships and community connections already established in rural communities through AMFU staff. By combining these strengths, the bank aims to deliver a reliable, technology-backed model that expands access to banking, supports local economies, and fosters sustainable growth.

Explaining the strategic intent behind the initiative, the bank said that ComBank Shakthi supports its goal of bringing banking services closer to all Sri Lankans while maintaining operational efficiency and competitiveness in a market. The model also complements the Bank’s sustainability agenda by promoting equitable access to financial services and empowering communities to save, invest, and grow.

Marking this milestone, Commercial Bank launched the pilot phase of its ComBank Shakthi Agency Banking operations at Iresha Food City in Weerawila, demonstrating the model in action. The event was graced by Commercial Bank COO S. Prabagar, Deputy General Manager Personal Banking S. Ganeshan, Assistant General Manager PBI/SME Mithila Shamini, Assistant General Manager Marketing Ashani Senaratne, Regional Manager Ruwan Panditharathna, Development Credit Department Senior Manager Malika de Silva, and Tissamaharama Branch Manager Amila Rathnayake.

Their presence underscored the bank’s strong commitment to expanding inclusive banking channels and collaborating with partners to reach new communities.
