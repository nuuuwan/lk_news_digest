Birthday gift turned lifeline: US-based young environmentalist steps up for Sri Lanka

For Daham Perera, a December birthday celebration this year became something far more meaningful than cake, candles or gatherings with friends. Instead, it turned into a deeply personal act of solidarity with a country he calls his motherland.

Perera, a young environmental enthusiast based in Los Angeles, says his bond with Sri Lanka remains unbroken despite living thousands of miles away. “Although I live in America, my parents and all my relatives live in beautiful Sri Lanka. That connection is something I carry with me every day, he said.

Having visited Sri Lanka in August, Perera spent weeks traveling across the island, reconnecting with relatives and visiting historical and environmentally significant sites. “I saw the true beauty of Sri Lanka – its people, its biodiversity, and its rich heritage. Those memories are among the most beautiful in my life, he recalled.

That joy, however, was short-lived. Soon after his return, the devastating Ditwah cyclone struck the island, leaving a trail of destruction. Homes were damaged, livelihoods disrupted and families displaced. “When I saw images of my friends losing their homes, books soaked in mud, clothes ruined by floodwaters, I felt a pain I cannot put into words, Perera said.

As an environmentalist, the damage to Sri Lanka’s fragile ecosystems troubled him deeply. “Sri Lanka’s biodiversity is priceless. When disasters like this strike, it is not just people who suffer, but forests, wildlife and entire ecosystems that take years to recover, he noted.

With his birthday falling on December 9, Perera made an unconventional decision. “Normally, my father and I celebrate our birthdays by going to the temple and spending time with friends. But this year, celebrating didn’t feel right when my people were suffering, he explained. “I kept asking myself—what can I do, even from afar?”

The answer was simple but powerful. Perera chose to donate all the money he had saved for his birthday celebrations, along with additional contributions from his family, towards relief efforts in Sri Lanka. “Economic support at times like this is critical. Even a small contribution can help a family rebuild, restart a livelihood, or regain dignity, he said.

The donation was formally handed over to Sri Lanka’s Consul General in Los Angeles, Charith Yattegoda, at the Consulate premises. For Perera, the gesture carried deep emotional significance. “If I can replace my personal happiness with smiles on the faces of people back home, that is the most beautiful birthday I could ever celebrate, he reflected.

He describes the letter of appreciation he received in return as his most treasured gift. “That thank-you letter is not just paper. It is a reminder that loving your country means standing by it in its darkest moments. It will always remain one of the most meaningful keepsakes of my life, Perera said.

Perera hopes his story will inspire other young Sri Lankans living overseas to stay connected and give back. “Distance should never weaken our responsibility. Supporting Sri Lanka—its people, its economy, and its environment—is something we can all do, no matter where we live, he added.

In turning a birthday into an act of compassion, Daham Perera has offered a quiet but powerful reminder: sometimes, the greatest gifts are the ones we give away.
