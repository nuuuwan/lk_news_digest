‘The producer behind your favorite hits is back and this time, he’s here for the underdogs’

The name might not always be on the marquee, but if you’ve listened to Sri Lankan music over the past two decades, you’ve heard Yohaan Rajapakse’s work. After shaping the sound of some of the island’s biggest artists, he’s now returning to the scene  this time, to lift up the voices that haven’t yet been heard.

Rajapakse’s story begins in the early 2000s  a golden era for Sri Lankan rock. As part of the band EZRA, Yohaan and his crew became household names after winning the TNL Onstage competition, one of the country’s most coveted music titles at the time. “The whole journey leading up to that win was unforgettable,” Yohaan recalls. “We were just a bunch of dreamers who believed we could make something new.” That victory marked the start of a career that would go on to transform the island’s sound.

He soon joined BNS’s first band, before discovering his real home wasn’t on stage, but behind the mixing desk. What followed was a career of firsts  producing Sri Lanka’s first Drum & Bass track with Ranidhu, breaking ground with B.K’s pioneering Hip Hop album “It’s Real,” and creating the country’s first R&B Tamil album with Krishan Maheson. Remember BNS’s “Hoiya Hoiya”? That infectious beat still gets radio play today  pure Rajapakse magic.
