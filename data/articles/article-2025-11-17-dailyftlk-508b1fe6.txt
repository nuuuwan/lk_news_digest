Sri Lanka named GCM Champion Country for leadership in migration governance

Sri Lanka has been officially recognised as a Global Compact for Migration (GCM) Champion Country, joining a select group of nations that demonstrate innovation and leadership in migration governance.

Sri Lanka has long championed safe, orderly, and regular migration as a driver of sustainable development. As one of the early endorsers of the GCM, the country has consistently aligned its migration policies with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

Building on this momentum, the Government officially announced its designation as a GCM Champion Country, launching the Migration and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Monitoring Platform (MSMP), and presented the revised National GCM Implementation Plan (2026-2028) during the high-level national symposium, supported by the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) in Sri Lanka and the Maldives. The event brought together stakeholders from Government Ministries, UN agencies, civil society, academia, and the private sector, reflecting a whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach to migration governance.

The MSMP is a new digital tool, launched by Sri Lanka’s Sustainable Development Council with support from the IOM Development Fund. The platform uses reliable data to show how migration contributes to national development goals, helping track progress and guide better decisions for an inclusive and resilient future.

Similarly, Sri Lanka has also introduced the revised National GCM Implementation Plan (2026–2028), a key step towards strengthening migration governance in response to post-crisis challenges and global trends. Led by the Foreign Affairs, Foreign Employment and Tourism Ministry, with technical support from the IOM and funding from the EU’s Building Migration Partnerships Program, the plan was developed through broad consultations to ensure it is practical and inclusive. It aims to strengthen the governance of migration in line with the principles of the GCM, enhance protection and support for migrant workers, and guide evidence-based policies that contribute to Sri Lanka’s SDGs.

IOM in Sri Lanka and the Maldives Chief of Mission Kristin Parco stated: “Sri Lanka has made notable strides in strengthening migration governance in recent years. As a GCM Champion Country, the country now serves as a positive model for many in the region. The development of the National GCM Implementation Plan 2026–2028 reflects this collaborative effort, translating global commitments into practical, actionable measures tailored to national priorities and realities.”

Together, the MSMP and the revised GCM Plan reaffirm Sri Lanka’s leadership in advancing migration governance that is inclusive, evidence-based and aligned with global development goals. For over a decade, the IOM in Sri Lanka and the Maldives has been working closely with the Government to strengthen migration policies, improve data systems, and build capacity, helping create better services for migrant workers and smarter decisions that support Sri Lanka’s development goals.
