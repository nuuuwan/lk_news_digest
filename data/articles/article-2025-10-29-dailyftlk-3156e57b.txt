WCIC’s 40th anniversary celebrations continue with “Empowering Future Female Entrepreneurs” workshop

60 undergraduates from 16 universities inspired through workshops, mentorship, and global connections

As part of its year-long 40th Anniversary celebrations, the Women’s Chamber of Industry and Commerce (WCIC) hosted another flagship initiative, “Empowering Future Female Entrepreneurs”, at Trace Expert City. The event brought together 60 ambitious female undergraduates from 16 universities across Sri Lanka for a full day of learning, mentorship, and inspiration.

The program is one in a series of monthly events designed to celebrate WCIC’s 40-year journey while investing in the future of women entrepreneurs.

WCIC Chairperson Gayani de Alwis said, “WCIC’s 40-year legacy is one of evolution and impact. We have always been and will continue to be a relevant and dynamic force, empowering women to transform Sri Lanka’s economy as powerful nation builders.”

The day featured a rich agenda of interactive workshops and sessions. The Makers Founder and CEO Nevindaree Premarathne led a practical workshop on Entrepreneurship on a Budget, teaching participants how to test ideas quickly through minimum viable products (MVPs) and creative branding.

WCIC Vice Chair, Macbertan Ltd., Managing Director and Pidilite Lanka Director Ramani Ponnambalam shared her entrepreneurial journey spanning manufacturing, finance, and leisure. She highlighted the importance of resilience and global partnerships, noting: “This was WCIC’s very first university-focused program, and it is just the beginning of building a robust pipeline of women entrepreneurs for Sri Lanka.”

Industry and Entrepreneurship Development Deputy Minister Chathuranga Abeysinghe introduced the Brain to Business graduate entrepreneurship program, urging participants to think big and adopt a purpose-driven approach: “Entrepreneurship is not only about creating a product, it is about solving problems, building networks, and having the passion to scale. Investors don’t invest in slides; they invest in people.”

WCIC Board Member, Magellan Champlain Founder Sarrah Sammoon delivered a session on Being a Global Citizen, highlighting that in today’s interconnected world, entrepreneurs should view the world as a marketplace. She emphasised the importance of strengthening one’s passport profile and building travel histories as a foundation for future opportunities: “Your passport may seem limited, but each visa proofed destination is a stepping stone. Global citizenship is a mindset, and it will transform your ventures.”

Collaboration was at the heart of the event. WCIC Board Member Zahara Ansary, who worked closely with the organising leads and board members, played a key role in making the initiative a success. She emphasised that programs like this both empower young women and strengthen WCIC’s role as a national platform for female-led innovation.

The workshop drew undergraduates from 16 universities, including the University of Colombo, University of Moratuwa, University of Peradeniya, University of Kelaniya, Sabaragamuwa University, Ocean University of Sri Lanka, NSBM Green University, NIBM, ICBT, ESOFT, Limkokwing University, and the Postgraduate Institute of Management, among others. Participants represented disciplines ranging from IT and engineering to agriculture, design, and economics. Notably, around 30% had already registered businesses, showcasing promising ideas from eco-products to fashion startups.

Students left not only with Certificates of Participation but also with actionable insights from testing business models on a shoestring, to building financial credibility, to leveraging global opportunities. Encouraged by the strength of this first cohort, WCIC announced its intent to make this initiative an annual program, expanding mentorship and support to help these future leaders scale their ventures and inspire the next wave of women entrepreneurs.

With over 360 members and a goal of reaching 500 by year’s end, WCIC continues to champion diverse, ethical, and sustainable growth. The Chamber’s mission remains clear: shaping the future of women in Sri Lanka by creating opportunities for professional development, fostering valuable connections, and empowering women to reach their fullest potential.

As WCIC’s 40th Anniversary celebrations continue month by month, the Empowering Future Female Entrepreneurs workshop stood out as a landmark investment in the next generation of women who will drive innovation, job creation, and economic transformation.
