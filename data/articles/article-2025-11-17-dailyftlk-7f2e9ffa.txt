Landmark initiative by FAO and Fisheries, Aquatic and Ocean Resources Ministry

The Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO), in collaboration with the Ministry of Fisheries, Aquatic and Ocean Resources and the National Aquaculture Development Authority (NAQDA), launched the Shrimp Industry Information System (SIIS) - Sri Lanka’s first-ever integrated digital platform for the aquaculture sector.

Developed under the FAO-led project “Smart and Sustainable Aquaculture through Effective Biosecurity and Digital Technology”, funded by the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries of the Republic of Korea, the SIIS marks a major milestone in advancing data-driven, biosecure, and sustainable shrimp farming in Sri Lanka.

The platform provides a unified digital ecosystem that connects shrimp farmers, laboratories, regulators, and policymakers through real-time data and analytics. It brings together Big Data, Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and early-warning systems to support decision-making, strengthen aquatic animal health, and ensure food safety and traceability.

Accessible through both mobile and web applications, SIIS allows users to monitor farm conditions, record water quality parameters, report diseases, and receive automated alerts and advisories. The platform also enables national-level visibility of aquaculture activities, facilitating proactive management and coordinated response to emerging risks.

Fisheries, Aquatic and Ocean Resources Minister Ramalingam Chandrasekar said: “This platform represents a transformative step in our efforts to modernise Sri Lanka’s aquaculture industry. By adopting digital and biosecure practices, our farmers can minimise losses, increase productivity, and compete more effectively in international markets. The SIIS will strengthen the foundation for a resilient, sustainable, and export-ready shrimp industry.”

The system enhances regulatory oversight through features such as digital licensing, GIS-based mapping, and traceability. It supports evidence-based policy planning and integrates seamlessly with Sri Lanka’s national digital ecosystem for improved inter-agency collaboration.

Ambassador of the Republic of Korea to Sri Lanka Miyon Lee said: “The Government of the Republic of Korea is proud to support Sri Lanka in this landmark achievement. Through the Smart Aquaculture Project, we aim to share Korea’s experience in digital transformation to help strengthen sustainable aquaculture and rural livelihoods. The SIIS demonstrates how technology can bring tangible benefits to farmers and contribute to national food security.”

The project emphasises capacity building, policy enhancement, and on-farm biosecurity to reinforce Sri Lanka’s aquaculture governance framework. Farmers, research institutions, and government agencies will receive continuous training to effectively use the platform and apply data-driven management practices.

FAO Representative in Sri Lanka and the Maldives Vimlendra Sharan said: “FAO is proud to support Sri Lanka in pioneering digital transformation in aquaculture. The SIIS is more than a platform - it is an ecosystem that connects people, data, and innovation. By leveraging smart technology, we can improve productivity, reduce disease risks, and strengthen livelihoods for coastal communities that depend on shrimp farming.”

The launch event was attended by representatives from the Ministry of Fisheries, Aquatic and Ocean Resources, Ministry of Digital Economy, NAQDA, NARA, DAPH, the Embassy of the Republic of Korea, and FAO, alongside shrimp farmers, researchers, and private sector partners. By integrating advanced digital tools with strong governance and field-level engagement, the SIIS positions Sri Lanka as a regional leader in smart aquaculture and sustainable food production.
