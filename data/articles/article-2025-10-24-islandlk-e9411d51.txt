Dilmah strengthens Sri Lanka’s water & ocean stewardship

Dilmah invited to be Patron of UN Global Compact Network, Sri Lanka’s Water & Ocean Stewardship Working Group

For Sri Lankans, Dilmah is more than a tea brand – it is heritage distilled in a cup, a name synonymous with authenticity, integrity, and the familiar aroma of home. Yet behind its global reputation lies something far more profound: a philosophy rooted in purpose, compassion, and stewardship. This ethos is anchored in the words of Dilmah Founder Merrill J. Fernando, who believed that “business is a matter of human service.” It is this guiding principle that continues to shape how Dilmah grows, innovates, and contributes to society – placing purpose above profit.

In recognition of this enduring commitment, Dilmah Ceylon Tea Company PLC has been invited to be Patron of the Water & Ocean Stewardship Working Group of the UN Global Compact Network Sri Lanka (Network Sri Lanka). This invitation is both an honor and a responsibility: an opportunity to amplify decades of leadership in conservation and inspire others to take action in Sri Lanka’s collective sustainability journey.

“Being named Patron amplifies the work that we are already doing,” said Rishan Sampath, Head of Sustainability and Conservation at Dilmah. “But more importantly, it gives us a platform to bring others with us – to build a national conversation, to share tools, and to invite new thinking.”

Water has always been at the heart of Dilmah’s philosophy. Reliable access to water sustains the tea industry, just as thriving ecosystems sustain communities. Recognizing this, Dilmah Conservation – the company’s environmental arm – has, since 2007, spearheaded over fifty initiatives to conserve, restore, and manage water resources. These include rainwater harvesting systems, community access to safe drinking water, wastewater recycling, and campaigns to reduce plastic pollution that threatens waterways.
