‘One Year of LIFE: Cinnamon Life celebrates a year that reimagined Colombo’

A year ago, the skyline of Colombo changed forever. Rising along the Beira Lake, Cinnamon Life at City of Dreams, Sri Lanka opened its doors, not just as a hotel, but as a bold promise of what the city could become. Twelve months later, that promise has come to life. Today, Cinnamon Life stands as a cultural heartbeat, a playground for dreamers, and a dazzling symbol of Sri Lanka’s hospitality renaissance.

What began as a destination has become an experience — a living, breathing celebration of the city’s rhythm. From rooftop concerts that echo into the night to glittering galas, art-filled corridors, and unforgettable weddings, Cinnamon Life has redefined how Colombo celebrates. It is where ideas meet art, where laughter lingers, and where the spirit of the city feels most alive.
