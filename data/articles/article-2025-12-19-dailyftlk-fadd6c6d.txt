HNB PLC has announced a partnership with Prime EV Automobiles Ltd., a subsidiary of Senok Trade Combine Ltd., to expand access to Deepal brand electric vehicles in Sri Lanka. The agreement was signed recently with the aim of strengthening national EV adoption while offering customers structured financial solutions through HNB Leasing.

“This partnership aligns with our long term commitment to expand access to advanced mobility in Sri Lanka,” said HNB SVP and Head of Retail Banking Kanchana Karunagama. “We see customers looking for practical financing from institutions they trust, and our early entry into green mobility financing has already helped shape industry standards. This collaboration offers a clear value proposition built on stability, accountability and consistent service delivery, and we are ready to support every customer who wants to move forward with confidence.”

Prime EV Automobiles serves as the local distributor for Deepal vehicles introduced by Changan Automobiles. The brand has recorded steady growth in multiple Asian & European markets and now enters Sri Lanka through a model backed by a leading financial institution. With HNB’s national footprint and its position as the first and the best in the local financial services sphere, customers will gain streamlined credit evaluation, competitive leasing packages and rapid processing times.

“Deepal vehicles are engineered with range optimisation, strong safety benchmarks and data driven diagnostics. We joined hands with HNB because its capacity to support new market categories is proven, and customer confidence rises when both distribution and financing partners operate with measurable reliability. We believe the Sri Lankan market can accelerate EV penetration through partnerships built on technical verification and responsible credit structures, and this agreement sets a strong path forward,” said Senok Trade Combine Ltd., Deputy Managing Director for Sales and Marketing Ranjan Dahanayake.

The partnership positions HNB as a key channel for EV financing at a time when Sri Lanka’s transport sector records rising interest in cost efficient mobility supported by lower operating expenses and upgraded energy infrastructure. Customers visiting any HNB branch will receive financial advisory support on vehicle models, repayment structures and eligibility guidelines. Delivery and technical support for Deepal models will be handled by Prime EV with service standards aligned to original manufacturer specifications.
