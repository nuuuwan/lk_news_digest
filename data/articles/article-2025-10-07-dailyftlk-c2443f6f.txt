Lanka IOC PLC has come on board to partner with Rescue Animals Sri Lanka (RAS), in the latter’s fundraiser, Gabriel’s Charity Auction and Fashion Show in aid of Rescue Animals Sri Lanka, on 31 October at the Cinnamon Grand.

Lanka IOC Managing Director Dipak Das said: “Sustainability is at the heart of our business model. Our decision to partner with RAS stems from our corporate commitment to provide environmentally responsible energy, and help engage communities establish win-win partnerships for humans and nature.”

RAS was founded by Anusha David, driven by her sheer love for animals and her deep desire to help as many as she could. Hailing from a family involved in caring for stray animals, her work in this field began over five decades ago.  From domestic to farm animals and wildlife, RAS’ work is all encompassing and includes street work amongst Community animals, running an animal sanctuary, rescuing farm animals, and battling court cases on behalf of beleaguered wildlife.

“Coexistence with nature and animal life is essential for all life, humans and animals alike. It is indeed heartening that Lanka IOC has come forward to partner with us in our endeavours and Das’ foresight and commitment is laudable and I can only hope that it will be emulated by other Corporates,” David said.
