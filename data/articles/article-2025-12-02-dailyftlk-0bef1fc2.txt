WindForce signs SPPA for  Rs. 1.18 b floating solar project

WindForce PLC said yesterday its subsidiary Diya Janani Ltd. signed a Standard Power Purchase Agreement with the Ceylon Electricity Board on 27 November for a floating solar project on the Dambulu Oya reservoir with an estimated cost of Rs. 1.2 billion.

The project, with a capacity of 6.5MWdc/5MWac, will be wholly owned by WindForce and financed on an 80:20 debt-equity structure. It is among the first large-scale floating solar developments undertaken by the private sector.

The company said the agreement marks a significant addition to its renewable energy portfolio as it increases its presence in advanced solar technologies. The project is expected to support the sector’s shift toward diversified clean-energy generation while strengthening WindForce’s pipeline of utility-scale assets.
