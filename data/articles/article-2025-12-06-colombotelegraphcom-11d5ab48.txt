Leadership In The Storm: How The AKD Govt. Is Turning The Ditwah Disaster Into A National Recovery Mission

“In the midst of chaos, there is also opportunity.” — Sun Tzu

When the AKD-led government assumed office, the nation was standing at the edge of an economic abyss. The economy had collapsed, debt obligations were suffocating, the IMF programme imposed strict fiscal discipline, and the public had lost faith in politics. Despite this unprecedented context, the new administration moved the country toward stabilization and began laying the foundation for its vision of “A Thriving Nation – A Beautiful Life.”

Yet Sri Lanka’s progress encountered an unexpected and devastating interruption: Cyclone Ditwah, one of the most destructive natural disasters in recent decades. Lives were lost, thousands were injured, countless families were displaced, and the economic cost remains unmeasured. Infrastructure collapsed, livelihoods vanished overnight, and entire communities were left without shelter, food, and electricity.

But disasters, throughout history, have also revealed the character of leadership. For President Anura Kumara Dissanayake and his government, the Ditwa disaster is the first major national test of their capability, vision, and resilience. Early indications show that the government has responded with earnestness, discipline, urgency, and a clear sense of duty—despite the complexities of operating under a restrictive economic climate.

This article examines how the government’s efforts deserve support, why opposition criticisms are unfounded and counterproductive, and how national unity can transform an unprecedented tragedy into a long-term foundation for recovery and resilience.

The immediate aftermath of a national disaster is not the moment for political mudslinging or baseless accusations. It is a time for compassion, solidarity, and collective responsibility. Every democratic nation in the world has understood that during moments of national crisis, unity becomes a moral obligation.

Opposition parties must rise above narrow political calculations. Criticising the government for being “inexperienced” or “incapable” during a crisis—while offering no constructive alternatives—serves no national purpose. Such behaviour weakens the morale of the public, demoralizes rescue workers, and damages Sri Lanka’s international image at a moment when global cooperation is essential.

Unity strengthens recovery; division delays it. At this moment of national tragedy, every institution beyond the government also carries a moral responsibility. Civil society, the corporate sector, religious organizations, and the media hold immense influence: they can either contribute to national healing or, through irresponsible commentary and politicized narratives, amplify chaos and uncertainty.

Fortunately, many responsible actors have already stepped forward with admirable commitment, recognising that recovery is a shared national duty—not a political contest. The government’s open call for collaboration, combined with its insistence on transparent, accountable, and publicly monitored fund management, is a decisive step toward rebuilding public trust during a period of profound uncertainty. This approach strengthens confidence, encourages participation, and demonstrates that recovery is being guided by discipline, integrity, and national interest.

Opposition critics argue that the AKD government lacks experience. But experience alone does not guarantee good governance—Sri Lanka’s past has proved that time and again. What matters is:

On these fronts, the government has shown commendable & credible commitment.

Operating within the limits of a strict IMF programme, the administration has already demonstrated financial discipline. Now, faced with the Ditwa disaster, it is managing four complex layers of responsibility simultaneously:

* Delivering targeted financial and social support to every affected family

* Mobilising domestic and foreign resources through accountable & transparent mechanisms

These tasks require systematic coordination, transparency, and wider national participation. No government can accomplish them alone—especially not in an economy recovering from historic collapse. Yet the early response indicates that the government has taken the proper steps, so it is on the right trajectory.

“Rebuilding Sri Lanka Fund”: A Foundation of Trust and Transparency

The establishment of the Rebuilding Sri Lanka Fund marks a significant milestone in the recovery process. Unlike disaster funds of the past or the Tsunami in 2004, which were too often plagued by mismanagement, political favoritism, and lack of transparency, this fund is designed to restore public confidence, nationally & internationally. Regarding the latter, it is essential to recognize the remarkable contribution of Sri Lanka’s diplomatic network, which has become an indispensable pillar of the national recovery effort. Sri Lanka’s High Commissions, embassies, consulates, and overseas missions have responded with exceptional urgency and professionalism. In particular, the newly established Sri Lanka High Commission in New Zealand, under the leadership of Mr. Prasanna Gamage, has demonstrated exemplary commitment by mobilizing the Sri Lankan community, engaging New Zealand authorities, and coordinating vital assistance with efficiency and integrity.

These missions are not merely administrative outposts—they are the nation’s extended front line during crises. Their swift action in securing international support, facilitating aid flows, building confidence among foreign partners, and amplifying the government’s message of transparency and accountability reflects a highly coordinated foreign-service response that deserves national recognition.

Their dedication proves that Sri Lanka’s recovery is not limited to domestic efforts alone; it is backed by a global network of professionals who stand united with the country at a moment when international goodwill, credibility, and responsible diplomacy are more crucial than ever.

To sustain local and international support, the fund must be:

These measures signal to citizens, donors, and global partners that Sri Lanka is committed to recovery without corruption, waste, or political interference.

Critics who accuse the government of lacking capacity conveniently ignore the fact that carefully structured and monitored funds are exactly how countries like Japan, New Zealand, and Chile recovered from national disasters with global credibility.

Leadership is not simply the ability to manage the present; it is the capacity to shape the future. President Anura Kumara Dissanayake has shown not only commitment to immediate relief but also a forward-looking strategy to build a more resilient Sri Lanka.

His leadership during this moment will determine how the public—and the world—perceives Sri Lanka’s direction.

The President has insisted that recovery efforts must not only rebuild what was lost but also lay foundations for:

This approach aligns with global best practices and positions Sri Lanka toward long-term resilience rather than short-term patchwork solutions.

Earlier, I wrote an article titled “The Meaning of Rata Anura.” That meaning becomes clearer today. The people now see a leader who (i) refuses to abandon responsibility, (ii) who faces tragedy head-on, and (iii) who believes in rebuilding a nation strong enough to withstand the storms of both nature and history.

“Future storms will be less lethal and less destructive with Anura.”

This is not a slogan—it is a reflection of leadership grounded in action, discipline, and integrity.

Many opposition forces have seized this moment—not to help, but to attack. Their criticisms fall into three categories:

These ignore the fact that the government is operating under IMF constraints but still delivering relief rapidly.

Without evidence, such claims are irresponsible and risk discouraging international donors.

This is morally unacceptable. No responsible political movement should exploit a natural disaster for electoral gain.

The public understands this. Trust is growing, not diminishing. People see a government that is present on the ground, listening to communities, coordinating with local authorities, and mobilising resources while managing national finances carefully.

What Sri Lanka needs now is not political theatre, but political maturity

Disasters reveal the strength of leadership. They expose weaknesses, but they can also highlight extraordinary determination.

President AKD’s handling of the Ditwa disaster will define the credibility of his administration and shape the public’s confidence in the months and years to come. His government must seize this moment to demonstrate:

Suppose these principles guide the government’s actions. In that case, the Ditwa disaster will be remembered not only for its devastation but also as the moment Sri Lanka turned a tragedy into a national rebirth.

Cyclone Ditwa has tested the strength, resolve, and character of the AKD-led government. Despite extraordinary hardship and the constraints of an inherited economic crisis, the administration has acted decisively, transparently, and compassionately.

This is not a time for division, nor for opportunistic attacks. It is a time for solidarity.

The opposition must act responsibly and support the national effort. Civil society and the corporate sector must continue to contribute. International partners must recognize Sri Lanka’s commitment to honest recovery.

If the government continues on this disciplined path, Sri Lanka will not only recover but will emerge stronger, more resilient, and more united than before. “Future storms will be less lethal and less destructive with Anura”, along with “The Meaning of Rata Anura.”

History tells us that nations rebuild fastest when they do so together. Today, Sri Lanka stands at that very crossroads.

With disciplined leadership, transparent governance, and national unity, the storm that brought destruction can become the storm that reshapes a stronger Sri Lanka towards “A Thriving Nation- A Beautiful Life”.
