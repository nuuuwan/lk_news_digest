‘The way forward is not to step back but to step up’

Bishop of Kandy Diocese Rt. Rev. Dr. Valence Mendis delivered a powerful message of solidarity and compassion at “Sounds of the Season,” an evening of harmony and reflection organised by Union Bank together with Port City and the Sri Lanka Institute of Directors (SLID), in support of communities affected by Cyclone Ditwah.

He said: “When the Organising Committee first met, there was serious debate about cancelling the event in light of the recent tragedy. After thoughtful reflection, the decision was unanimous: the right path forward was not to step back, but to step up. The concert was therefore transformed into a purposeful gathering of remembrance and compassion. The evening focused not on celebration, but on honouring those who lost their lives, supporting those who were injured, and standing in solidarity with children who have lost their parents and now face an uncertain future.”

He concluded by thanking those present for standing with the children and families affected by Cyclone Ditwah and for helping restore hope where it is needed most. The Soul Sounds Academy choirs, the Union Bank choir, and guest performers Alston Koch and the De Lanerolle Brothers created an atmosphere of hope and solidarity throughout the evening.
