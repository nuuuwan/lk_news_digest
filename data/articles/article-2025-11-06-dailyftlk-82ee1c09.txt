Sarrah Sammoon honoured among ‘Influential Women of the World’ in Paris

Entrepreneur and global mobility leader Sarrah Sammoon has been recognised as one of the ‘Influential Women of the World – Global Awardees’, Edition 6 - Dr Monica Garg, an international honour celebrating measurable, society-shaping impact by women across sectors.

The awards gathering took place at the Ritz Paris, with programming that included an intimate visit to CHANEL, 19 rue Cambon, a Louis Vuitton French tea at Place Vendôme, and a private visit to La Galerie Dior.

Sarrah is the Founder and CEO of Magellan Champlain (M|C), an advisory at the nexus of global mobility, investor migration and cross-border strategy. She is also the Founder of SCOR Literary Salon. For three decades, M|C has served corporates, founders and families with compliant, design-led solutions spanning visas, residencies and investment structures. Sarrah doesn’t claim to be “living the best life”; she chooses, daily, to live in alignment, integrating prosperity with purpose, beauty with integrity, and success with service.

‘I was nominated by my friend, Elke Berr, and from there the awards follow a formal judging process that measures real-world impact which makes this recognition especially meaningful’ said Sarrah. ‘Over the years I’ve been grateful for different recognitions. This one is special. When my friend Elke, the ‘Indiana Jane’ of gemstones told me this network gathers remarkable women, I listened. Then Dr. Monica Garg shared her purpose: ‘Nothing could be better than to see each woman crossing national boundaries and reaching out globally.’ That is my life’s work, bridging the Global North and South and building dignified pathways for people and capital to move responsibly.’

The Paris programme paired luxury fashion houses with learning. Morning workshops and an afternoon conference featured topics such as financial agency for women, well-being, the power of the smile, real-time design thinking for career and inner growth, haute couture embroidery heritage to innovation, storytelling for business lift-off, and finding an irresistible leadership voice.

Awardees were also featured in a limited-edition international coffee-table book launched at the Ritz Paris, capturing success stories from around the world, an elegant reminder, as Sarrah noted, “to pause, acknowledge our contributions, and keep going with grace.”

With three decades at the helm of cross-border mobility and investment migration, Sarrah is evolving her work into a refined platform of Global Citizenship Advisory, where rigorous compliance and capital strategy meet a consciously lived life. Her thesis is simple and unapologetic: you can live anywhere, build well, and live beautifully without disowning your spiritual centre. ‘Opportunity without meaning is incomplete,’ she notes. ‘My mission is to help people and institutions move capital, talent, and ideas across borders ethically, elegantly, and for the common good, so they can embrace prosperity and purpose without apology.’
