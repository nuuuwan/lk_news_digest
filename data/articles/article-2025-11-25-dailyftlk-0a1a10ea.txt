Elpitiya Plantations celebrates dedication and excellence at Estate Staff Awards

Elpitiya Plantations recently held two distinguished award ceremonies for its Upcountry and Low Country estate staff to recognise and celebrate their dedication, hard work, and outstanding contributions to the company’s success. These events were a testament to the company’s ongoing commitment to its workforce and the vital role estate employees play in maintaining the quality and productivity of its plantations.

The Upcountry Region ceremony was held on 31 October at the scenic Araliya Green Hills Hotel in Nuwara Eliya, attended by over 200 staff members. The event was graced by Elpitiya Plantations PLC Managing Director Dr. Rohan Fernando and Director/CEO Geeth Kumara Dayananda. In a warm and inspiring ceremony, over 100 awards were presented to estate staff who demonstrated exceptional dedication, skill, and service. The awards covered a broad range of categories recognising excellence in productivity, innovation, and long service.

Following this, the Low Country Region recognised its team on 7 November in Hikkaduwa, also hosting over 200 staff members and presenting over 100 awards. The awards recognised not only individual achievements but also team efforts that have contributed to the success and sustainability of the plantations.

Elpitiya Plantations has a longstanding tradition of valuing its employees, acknowledging that their passion and perseverance are the foundation of the company’s reputation and growth. Dr. Rohan Fernando said: “Our estate staff are the true pillars of Elpitiya Plantations. Their dedication sustains our operations and drives our commitment to excellence in all aspects of plantation management.”

Geeth Kumara Dayananda said, “These ceremonies are about more than just awards. They are about honoring the spirit of teamwork, resilience, and loyalty that define our workforce. We are proud to invest in our people and celebrate their successes which inspire us all.”

These award ceremonies also serve as an important platform for encouraging continuous improvement and innovation in estate operations. By publicly acknowledging the hard work of its employees, Elpitiya Plantations fosters a culture that values quality, safety, and sustainability, which is critical in today’s competitive agricultural environment.

With more than 400 employees recognised across the two regions, Elpitiya Plantations is setting a strong example in the plantation industry, demonstrating that investing in people is just as critical as investing in land and machinery. Moving forward, the company will continue to support employee development through training, career growth opportunities, and wellbeing initiatives to ensure a vibrant and motivated team.
