ComBank celebrates pensioners with a dedicated event in Gampaha

The Commercial Bank of Ceylon reaffirmed its commitment to the welfare of senior citizens by organising a dedicated day to celebrate and honour pensioners. This special event was organised by the Bank’s Retail Products Department together with the Bank’s Gampaha Branch.

The event, held at the Royal Chance Palace Hotel, Gampaha, brought together more than 250 pensioners for a morning of health checks, learning, entertainment and fellowship.

Guests included Government pensioners, Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) pensioners and Central Bank pensioners, who were treated to an engaging and informative programme. Among the highlights were a presentation on non-communicable diseases by a Government University Lecturer, a free medical health camp conducted in collaboration with Asiri Hospital – Kandy, and presentations by Commercial Bank on the financial facilities available to pensioners, including the Bank’s Pension Loan product.

Participants were also able to apply for pension loans and obtain information on other financial services at the venue. The event concluded with a lively entertainment segment by two popular comedians, followed by snacks and lunch for all attendees.

The Bank said the event was organised to strengthen relationships with the senior citizen community and to promote financial wellbeing among pensioners in the Gampaha District.
