The aircraft also carried family tents, blankets, bedding, life jackets, inflatable boats, water-removal pumps, lamps, mats, mosquito nets, infant milk powder, dry rations and medical supplies.

Pakistani High Commissioner to Sri Lanka Major General (Retd.) Faheem Al Aziz received the consignment at the airport, along with officials from the High Commission. Ports and Civil Aviation Deputy Minister Janaka Ruwan Kodithuwakku and other Sri Lankan representatives were also present.
