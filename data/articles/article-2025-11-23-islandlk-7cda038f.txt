Union Assurance report exposes silent Diabetes crisis in Sri Lanka

Union Assurance’s ‘Suwamaga Impact Report,’ reviewing 15 months of its flagship CSR initiative, reveals critical insights into Sri Lanka’s diabetes epidemic. The nationwide programme provided free screenings to over 23,000 individuals across all 25 districts, surpassing its goal by 155%.

The data uncovers a severe health crisis. Among those flagged for advanced HbA1c testing, 76% were diagnosed with diabetes. Alarmingly, nearly 3% of all beneficiaries learned they had diabetes for the first time through this initiative.

Beyond diagnosis, the programme drove tangible behavioural change, with 71% of beneficiaries adopting healthier lifestyles. The initiative, featuring a mobile screening unit with healthcare professionals, provided critical early detection and risk management.

“This report underscores the urgent need for collective action,” said CEO Senath Jayatilake. “We have demonstrated significant impact and call on all stakeholders to join us in strengthening national prevention strategies.”

Union Assurance remains committed to expanding this vital work, empowering Sri Lankans to protect their health and future.
