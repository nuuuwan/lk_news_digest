As Sri Lanka accelerates its transition toward a greener and more resilient economy, Aberdeen Holdings, a diversified conglomerate operating across more than eight industries, has reaffirmed its commitment to sustainability by achieving Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Verification Certification under the ISO 14064-1:2018 standard.

This certification represents a key milestone in the Group’s sustainability journey, underscoring its dedication to measuring, managing, and transparently reporting greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with international best practices. By embedding data-driven accountability and transparency into its operations, Aberdeen Holdings continues to translate its sustainability ambitions into measurable climate action.

Sustainability is at the heart of the Group’s diverse portfolio, spanning energy and eco-solutions, logistics and packaging, agri and commodities, healthcare and wellness, and aviation, encompassing over 20 subsidiaries. Entities such as Ex-Pack Corrugated Cartons PLC, Hienergy Services, and Neptune Recyclers are driving innovation in renewable energy, carbon-neutral manufacturing, and circular economy solutions.

The GHG Verification Certification not only strengthens Aberdeen Holdings’ contribution to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) but also reinforces its role in building a greener, more resilient Sri Lanka. This achievement marks not an endpoint, but a continuation of the Group’s long-term vision, to create meaningful impact through sustainable practices, balancing business growth with environmental responsibility.
