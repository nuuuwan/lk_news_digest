Sri Lanka’s vanishing snakes: Scientists warn policy paralysis is driving a silent crisis

Sri Lanka may proudly call itself a global biodiversity hotspot, but in the world of reptiles—especially snakes—the country is sleepwalking into a conservation crisis.Behind the scientific accolades lies a sobering truth: our policy frameworks are outdated, enforcement is weak, research is underfunded, and environmental governance is collapsing just as fast as the habitats snakes depend on.

“We keep discovering new species, but we’re losing habitats far faster than we can study them. Policy simply has not kept pace with science,” says herpetologist Suranjan Karunarathna, whose field teams continue to document the island’s breathtaking snake diversity.

Sri Lanka shelters 112 snake species, 63 of which are endemic—a level of uniqueness unmatched in South Asia. But scientists say the country’s laws and regulatory structures protect these species only on paper.

The Wildlife Conservation Ordinance is decades old and struggles to cover the complex realities of modern development, urban sprawl and climate change.

“Fragmentation is one of the biggest threats—but environmental approvals are being given with minimal regard for microhabitats, altitudinal ranges, or ecological corridors,” says Dr. Dushantha Kandambi, highlighting how even threatened and range-restricted species fall through bureaucratic cracks.

Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) rarely examine the fine-scale habitat needs of snakes. Many species—especially burrowing forms—can vanish from a site without ever being counted.

“A single road or tea expansion can wipe out an entire endemic population, but current assessments don’t reflect that.”

Even the rules that do exist suffer from chronic non-implementation.

Illegal land clearing, pesticide misuse, sand mining, and toxic effluents from industries continue largely unchecked. Scientists say enforcement agencies do not have the manpower, technical expertise, or political backing needed to regulate these pressures.

“We are losing snakes to chemicals and pollutants long before anyone realises what happened. But monitoring is almost nonexistent,” Karunarathna told The Island.

He added despite snakes being legally protected, killings in villages remain widespread, with no systematic response mechanism or structured data collection.

No national programme exists for safe relocation, community-level identification training, or village-based rapid responders—even though such systems have been successful in India and Nepal.

While Sri Lanka’s climate policies talk broadly about biodiversity, they rarely address species-specific vulnerabilities—especially for cold-blooded animals.

“Snakes are extremely temperature-sensitive. Climate shifts affect reproduction, hibernation, and prey cycles. We need predictive models and adaptation plans, but none exist,” Kandambi stresses.

Sri Lanka has no national research agenda on the impacts of extreme weather, warming trends, or rainfall anomalies on reptile populations—even though the country ranks among the world’s most climate-vulnerable.

Despite their ecological importance, snakes remain one of the least-studied major groups.

“We don’t even fully know where some endemic species occur. Without baseline data, how can we protect them?” Karunarathna asks.

Meanwhile, taxonomic work—often funded by small international grants—has outpaced local conservation policy by nearly a decade. Sri Lankan research teams have described several new species recently, yet none have been incorporated into national red lists or land-use planning frameworks.

Tea, rubber, and paddy landscapes are expanding into forest margins faster than regulations can track.

While the Department of Agriculture has pesticide guidelines, field scientists say enforcement is almost nonexistent.

“Runoff from agrochemicals doesn’t just kill pests—it changes entire food webs. Frogs decline, rodents increase, and snakes either starve or wander into villages, increasing conflict,” Kandambi explains.

Still, the country has no regulation compelling large plantations to maintain ecological buffers around sensitive habitats.

Karunarathna and Kandambi say Sri Lanka urgently needs a National Snake Conservation Policy—a structured, modern, science-based framework. They outline the following priorities:

Include lesser-known and newly described species, strengthen penalties, and restrict development in critical habitats.

Sri Lanka’s snakes do not roar, charge, or dominate the landscape. Their decline is quiet, often invisible. But the consequences—ecological imbalance, rodent surges, collapsing food webs—will be anything but quiet.

“If policy does not change soon, we will lose species before we even discover them,” Karunarathna warns.

The question now is whether policymakers will listen—or allow yet another chapter of Sri Lanka’s natural heritage to disappear silently … beneath the leaves.
