Prime Group launches integrated property technology ecosystem

Prime Group has established itself as the definitive digital leader in Sri Lankan real estate by launching the nation’s first fully integrated property technology ecosystem. This strategic, multi-year digital transformation has redefined the ownership experience through seamless, sector-first innovations.

The Group’s distinction lies in its holistic platform, which integrates pioneering solutions across the customer journey. Key innovations include the industry-exclusive 1322 hotline, a fintech partnership with DFCC Bank’s iConnect for paperless transactions, and the Prime Edge mobile application for end-to-end portfolio management. Further enhancing accessibility are AI-driven tools like Prime Bee and smart building management systems.

By unifying procurement, construction, project management, and customer workflows into a single secure ecosystem, Prime Group sets new industry benchmarks for operational excellence, transparency, and customer-centricity. This comprehensive digital infrastructure positions the company not merely as a developer, but as a technology-driven architect of modern property experience.
