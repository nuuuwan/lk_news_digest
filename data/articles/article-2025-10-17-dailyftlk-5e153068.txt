COPE rebukes CIDA for Rs. 15 m legal costs, staff harassment claims

The Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) yesterday criticised the Construction Industry Development Authority (CIDA) for allegedly harassing an employee on personal grounds and spending nearly Rs. 15 million on legal fees in connection with the case.

It was revealed during the COPE session that the CIDA had paid a lawyer Rs. 600,000 per Court appearance in the case filed against an employee, who was later reinstated following a Court order. The CIDA has since appealed the judgment.

COPE members also raised concerns over a planned Rs. 5.9 million renovation of the Authority’s office roof, noting that the contractor’s quotation had not been properly verified.
