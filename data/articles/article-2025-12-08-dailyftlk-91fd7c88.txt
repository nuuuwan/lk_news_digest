India delivers Bailey bridge to support Sri Lanka’s post-Cyclone recovery

India has delivered 110-ft-long, customisable, modular Bailey Bridge units to Sri Lanka along with engineering expertise to support reconstruction efforts following the devastation caused by Cyclone Ditwah.

The cargo, weighing 65 tons and comprising 100 metres of Bailey bridge components, was handed over on Saturday to Colonel Batuwanthudawa of the Sri Lanka Army. The transfer was facilitated through the High Commission of India in Colombo. In addition to the bridge units, a 13-member Engineering Corps from the Indian Army has arrived to assist in the installation and provide technical support to local teams.

Authorities said the rapid deployment of the Bailey bridge will help restore vital transport links in areas cut off by the cyclone, enabling access for relief delivery and reconstruction activities.

Cyclone Ditwah caused extensive damage to roads, bridges and other critical infrastructure across several districts, leaving communities isolated. Joint teams from the Sri Lanka Army and the Indian Engineering Corps are expected to begin work on bridge construction in the coming days.

The latest assistance reflects India’s continued support towards Sri Lanka’s disaster response and recovery initiatives.
