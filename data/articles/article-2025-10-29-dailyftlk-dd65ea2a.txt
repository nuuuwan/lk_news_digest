Singapore’s Trafigura gets 7-month diesel contract

The Cabinet of Ministers at their meeting on Monday, agreed on awarding the contract to supply diesel for seven months, starting 15 November, to Singapore’s Trafigura Ltd., following competitive bids.

The Government said the move follows seven bids called from registered suppliers of Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC).

“Bids were called from the registered suppliers of CPC to purchase five shipments of diesel (0.05% M.S.) barrels of 1,400,000 +/- 5% for the period of seven months from 15 November 2025 to 14 June 2026,” Acting Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Vijitha Herath said at the post-Cabinet meeting with the media yesterday.

Accordingly, the Cabinet of Ministers approved the proposal tabled by Power Minister Eng. Kumara Jayakody to award the relevant contract for Vitol Asia (Singapore) Ltd., as recommended by the High-Level Standing Procurement Committee appointed by the Cabinet of Ministers.
