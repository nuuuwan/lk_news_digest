LTL Transformers secures $2.6 Mn export order to Mauritius

Sri Lanka’s LTL Transformers Private Limited has secured a major export order of 350 high-efficiency Amorphous Transformers to the State of Mauritius, valued at over USD 2.6 million, highlighting the country’s engineering expertise on a global scale.

The order, awarded through an International Competitive Bidding (ICB) process by the Central Electricity Board of Mauritius, saw LTL Transformers outperform leading international manufacturers. The formal handover ceremony for the shipment was held yesterday at the company’s facility.

The transformers were verified through independent factory inspections and Factory Acceptance Tests (FAT) to meet IEC standards and the technical requirements of Mauritius’ electricity board.

Speaking at the event, LTL Transformers CEO Rukki Patberiya noted that the company has installed more than 16,000 transformers across Sri Lanka, generating millions in revenue. The 350 transformers will be shipped in phases, with a total of 750 units destined for Mauritius.

Amorphous-core transformers reduce no-load losses, minimize energy wastage, improve efficiency, and lower the carbon footprint, representing a significant step toward sustainable power generation. LTL Transformers’ facility adheres to international standards in design, engineering, manufacturing, and testing, strengthening its position as a reliable global supplier.

This milestone not only boosts Sri Lanka’s economy but also showcases the skill and capability of Sri Lankan engineers across Africa, Asia, and the Middle East.
