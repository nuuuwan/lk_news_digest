Browns Agriculture was recently honoured with the prestigious Gold Award for “Global Brand of the Year” for its Browns SUMO WORLD Harvester at the SLIM Brand Excellence Awards 2025. Organised by the Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing (SLIM), the national body for marketing in Sri Lanka, the event is one of the country’s most respected platforms that celebrates outstanding brands, strategic excellence and impactful marketing leadership. Held at the Monarch Imperial, the ceremony recognised brands that continue to shape industries, communities and the national economy.

For over 100 years, Browns Agriculture has been at the forefront of mechanising Sri Lanka’s farming sector. This century-long legacy in agricultural innovation laid the foundation for the creation of the Browns Harvester, which today stands as the country’s number one harvester, commanding an impressive 73% share of the national market. Designed and customised specifically for Sri Lankan paddy fields, the Browns Harvester is engineered to endure local soil conditions, varying terrains and climatic challenges, making it the best fit for Sri Lankan cultivators seeking a reliable and high-performing solution.

Offering a fully mechanised range from 15 HP to 100 HP under two trusted brands, Browns SUMO WORLD and Browns Yanmar, the Harvester portfolio supports diverse crop systems across Sri Lanka. While paddy remains the core focus, these machines are also engineered to handle maize, sugarcane, and other crops, enabling scalability and diversification for farmers. Advanced monitoring systems track machine performance in real time, allowing remote maintenance adjustments and ensuring uninterrupted operation throughout the harvesting season.

Browns’ strong service commitment has been a defining force behind the Harvester’s reputation, reinforced by Sri Lanka’s most extensive after-sales and spare-parts network, ensuring farmers experience minimum downtime. Whenever a machine faces an issue, Browns’ skilled technical teams travel directly to the farmer’s doorstep or paddy field no matter how remote to restore operations quickly and reliably. This unwavering support has earned the trust of farming communities across the island. Season after season, as the Harvester proved its durability in real working conditions, Browns’ field teams have stood beside farmers, listening to their challenges, working knee-deep in muddy fields, and strengthening engagement through brand activations and digital platforms. Today, this exceptional service ecosystem has made the Browns Harvester synonymous with value, dependability and long-lasting performance in both urban and rural farming communities.

Browns Agriculture and Heavy Equipment Cluster Chief Operating Officer, Browns Agri Solutions CEO, and AgStar Non-Executive Director Sanjaya Nissanka said, “For our local farmers, the Browns Harvester is more than a machine; it’s a lifeline. It ensures harvests are completed on time, without costly breakdowns or delays. Every feature has been designed to help cultivators work smarter, save fuel and make informed decisions through advanced technology that connects them directly to their fields. With Browns’ reliable 24/7 service support, they know help is always just a call away. In agriculture, where every day counts, reliability means everything.”
