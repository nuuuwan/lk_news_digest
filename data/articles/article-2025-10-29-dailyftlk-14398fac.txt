Sri Lankan Parliamentary delegation visits UK to strengthen governance and bilateral ties

A high-level delegation from the Parliament of Sri Lanka is undertaking a four-day visit to the United Kingdom this week to strengthen bilateral Parliamentary relations, share experiences, and discuss ways to improve governance through Parliament, the British High Commission in Colombo said in a statement yesterday.

The delegation includes Speaker Dr. Jagath Wickramaratne, Health Minister and Chief Government Whip Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa, Justice Minister Harshana Nanayakkara, Women and Child Affairs Minister Saroja Savithri Paulraj, and Assistant Secretary General of Parliament Hansa Abeyratne.

The visit, facilitated by the Westminster Foundation for Democracy (WFD) and funded by UK International Development, focuses on institutional frameworks and practices that promote transparency, accountability, and effective legislation.

A key area of focus is post-legislative scrutiny (PLS) â€“ the practice of reviewing laws after they have been passed to assess their effectiveness and ensure they deliver intended outcomes for citizens. The delegation is engaging with UK Parliamentarians, committee staff, and oversight bodies to understand how PLS strengthens governance, including on anti-corruption.

The delegation will also meet ministerial counterparts in the UK Government to discuss ongoing UK-Sri Lanka cooperation, including Minister for the Indo-Pacific at the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office Seema Malhotra MP.
