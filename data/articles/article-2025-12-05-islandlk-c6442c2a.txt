Sri Lanka claims regional spotlight as DC Group wins Gold for Digital Innovation Agency of the Year – South Asia and Rest of South Asia

DC Group marked a significant milestone for Sri Lanka’s creative and digital sector by becoming the first Sri Lankan agency to be awarded Gold for Digital Innovation Agency of the Year South Asia at the Campaign Agency of the Year Awards 2025. The agency also received Gold for Digital Innovation Agency of the Year Rest of South Asia, placing a homegrown independent firm among the region’s leading innovators in a field traditionally dominated by global networks and larger regional markets.

The recognition, announced in Mumbai, highlights the agency’s rise from its beginnings in 2017, when it operated out of a 100 square foot room with no legacy clients and no traditional advertising pedigree. Since then, DC Group has evolved into a multi-disciplinary digital organisation, demonstrating the potential of independent agencies emerging from smaller markets and reframing perceptions of Sri Lankan creativity on the regional stage.

“This is more than an award. It’s a milestone for Sri Lankan creativity and digital innovation,” said Arjun Jeger, Co-Founder & Managing Partner of DC Group. “For a homegrown agency to be named South Asia’s best in digital innovation shows the world that Sri Lanka can compete, and win, at the highest level.”

Co-Founder & Creative Chairman Prasad Karunarathne noted that the achievement reflects the values that shaped the agency’s journey. “This win belongs to every Sri Lankan who believes in pushing boundaries. Our journey wasn’t built on legacy or inheritance, it was built on culture, creativity, and the courage to challenge what an agency can be. Winning two Gold awards on a South Asian stage is proof that independent agencies from Sri Lanka can stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the biggest names in the region.”

He continued: “Innovation isn’t about having the biggest budgets. It’s about the strongest ideas, the right people, and a unified team, and that is what defines DC.”
