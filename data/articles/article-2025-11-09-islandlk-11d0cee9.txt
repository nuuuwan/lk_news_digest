Childhood depression: A psychosocial perspective

Recent findings reveal a troubling reality about the mental well-being of Sri Lankan children. According to a study cited in The Island on 12, 2025, nearly 60 percent of school students in the country experience symptoms of depression, with 24 percent of senior students showing significant symptoms.

Speaking at a World Mental Health Day event in Colombo, Professor Miyuru Chandradasa, President of the Sri Lanka College of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, identified academic pressure, parental conflict, social media exposure, and physical abuse as key contributors to this growing crisis.

Though I have not had direct access to the research data, the reported figures alone paint a deeply worrying picture. They demand not only public reflection but also urgent action. These are our future citizens, and their mental well-being today will shape the moral and social fabric of our nation tomorrow.

I read with great interest the article “Childhood Depression: A Critical Issue” (The Island, 27 October, 2025), by Geewananda Gunawardana PhD, my fellow alumnus from the University of Peradeniya, whose insights on the harmful impact of social media use among children are both timely and persuasive. My purpose here is to extend that conversation by exploring the psychosocial dimensions of this silent epidemic.

Formative years of childhood and adolescence constitute a critical period for physical, cognitive, social and emotional development. The emotional well-being of children requires a nurturing environment – a space that provides safety, support and love, enabling to feel secure, valued and encouraged to explore and learn.

A nurturing family environment forms the cornerstone of emotional well-being. Children thrive in homes that balance love with discipline, structure with freedom, and guidance with understanding. Unfortunately, modern life increasingly undermines this balance. Many parents, pressured by demanding work schedules or compelled to seek employment abroad, struggle to devote time and attention to their children.

For families separated by migration, emotional bonds weaken, leaving children vulnerable to loneliness and confusion. Economic necessity, while understandable, has created a generation growing up with emotional instability.

Parental conflict, inconsistent discipline, and poor role modelling, further compound the problem. Without stability at home, a child’s emotional resilience erodes, often manifesting as anxiety, irritability, or withdrawal.

Education is meant to nurture the mind and spirit. Yet for many Sri Lankan children, the school experience has become a relentless race. The culture of excessive tuition — driven by parental anxiety and competition — leaves little room for creativity, recreation, or social development.

While targeted academic support has its value, the obsession with results has turned childhood into a cycle of stress and exhaustion. The absence of vocational alternatives and career paths and the uneven distribution of quality educational facilities across the country further add to the pressure.

A more balanced approach is essential — one that values emotional well-being alongside academic achievement.

The Island reported on 05 October, 2025, that crimes against children — including physical and sexual abuse, murder, and exploitation — have increased alarmingly over the past three years, according to the National Audit Office.

In many households and schools, corporal punishment remains justified as a means of “discipline,” often under the guise of being “for the child’s own good.” Yet decades of research have shown that such punishment inflicts deep psychological scars. It diminishes self-esteem, impairs social skills, and contributes to long-term emotional instability.

A culture of empathy, active listening, and firm but compassionate guidance must replace the outdated notion that fear produces respect.

Today’s children are “digital natives” — immersed in a world of screens, social media, and virtual connections. While technology can enhance learning and creativity, it also exposes children to inappropriate content, misinformation, cyberbullying, predatory algo rhythms and privacy risks.

Without adequate parental supervision and open communication, children may retreat into the virtual world, leading to social isolation and mental strain. Those already feeling alienated from family are particularly at risk of self-harm when bullied online.

Parents must take responsibility by setting boundaries, monitoring online activity, and encouraging real-world interaction through creative and recreational pursuits. Parents, not algo rhythms, should guide children. As several nations have adopted, setting a minimum age for accessing social media should be considered.

Depression is often misunderstood as a simple extension of sadness. In clinical terms, it is a persistent lowering of mood, accompanied by changes in thought, behaviour, and body function — such as sleep or appetite disturbances.

Diagnosing depression in children is complex, as symptoms vary by age and developmental stage. Younger children may not articulate sadness but may show behavioural changes — loss of interest, irritability, school refusal, or unexplained physical complaints.

Adolescents may express their distress through apathy, irritability, poor concentration, or substance misuse. The hormonal and social turbulence of adolescence heightens their vulnerability.

While many cases respond well to counselling and cognitive-behavioural interventions, medication may be required for carefully selected cases of older adolescents with major depression. In all cases, family involvement remains central to recovery.

As Professor Chandradasa has rightly emphasised, the role of the psychiatric profession is to present the facts honestly and to treat affected individuals effectively. But beyond individual therapy lies a broader social challenge — the urgent need for systemic change.

Childhood depression on this scale reflects a deeper societal malaise — the erosion of family stability, inequities in education, economic strain, and a breakdown of community values. Addressing these root causes requires cohesive policy planning, inter-sectoral collaboration, and above all, political will.

Mental health cannot be treated in isolation from social health. If the next generation is to inherit a society worth living in, we must rebuild the environments — at home, in school, and in the digital space — that nurture rather than diminish the human spirit.

Childhood should be a time of discovery, security, and joy — not anxiety, alienation, and despair. The rising tide of depression among children is not merely a medical issue; it is a national crisis that demands moral reflection and collective action.

Our deepest desire, as a society, should be simple yet profound: to see our children happy.
