John Keells Holdings doubles EBITDA to Rs.18.3Bn, signals even stronger second-half

The Group delivered a strong quarterly performance marked by the contribution from its new investments and businesses as well as a robust contribution across the portfolio. The operationalising of key investments in the first half of the year provides a strong platform to translate to an enhanced profit contribution over the second half and the ensuing financial year.

Group earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) at Rs.18.36 billion in the second quarter of the financial year 2025/26 is a significant increase of 127% against Group EBITDA of Rs.8.09 billion recorded in the corresponding period of the previous financial year.

Cumulative Group EBITDA for the first half of the financial year 2025/26 at Rs.31.33 billion is an increase of 98% against the previous year. Given the high seasonality in many of our businesses, the second half performance is expected to improve further over the first half. The Group recurring EBITDA for the full financial year 2024/25 was Rs. 45.69 billion.

Group profit before tax (PBT) at Rs.7.80 billion in the quarter under review is a significant increase of 243% against the Rs.2.27 billion recorded in the second quarter of 2024/25.

Group profit after tax (PAT) at Rs.4.20 billion in the second quarter of the financial year 2025/26 is an increase of 176% against the Rs.1.52 billion recorded in the previous financial year while the profit attributable to equity holders of the parent is Rs.1.65 billion compared to Rs.1.37 billion in the corresponding period of the previous financial year.

The profit attributable to equity holders of the parent, excluding City of Dreams Sri Lanka and JKCG, is Rs.2.61 billion in the quarter under review compared to Rs.692 million in the corresponding period of the previous financial year. (JKH)
