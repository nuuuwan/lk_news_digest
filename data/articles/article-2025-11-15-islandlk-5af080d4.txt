Sampath Bank maintains its growth momentum in 2025, recording a 21% increase in profit after tax for the nine-month period

Sampath Bank reported a Profit Before Tax (PBT) of Rs 35.3 Bn and a Profit After Tax (PAT) of Rs 21.5 Bn for the nine-month period ended 30th September 2025, reflecting consistent year-on-year growth of 18% and 21% respectively. Furthermore, the Group delivered a strong financial performance, recording a PBT of Rs 38.0 Bn and a PAT of Rs 23.1 Bn for the same period, marking growth of 19% and 21% respectively.

The Bank’s total interest income declined by 3% year-on-year for the nine-month period ended 30th September 2025, reaching Rs 134.0 Bn. This decrease was primarily driven by the continued reduction in the Average Weighted Prime Lending Rate (AWPLR) and lower yields from government securities. Interest expenses saw a corresponding decrease of 2% year-on-year to Rs 76.8 Bn, reflecting the overall downward trend in market interest rates. Consequently, the Bank’s Net Interest Income (NII) contracted by 6% year-on-year to Rs 57.2 Bn. The Net Interest Margin (NIM) narrowed by 81 basis points, from 4.90% as at 31st December 2024, to 4.09% as at 30th September 2025.

The Bank reported a robust 107% year-on-year increase in total non-fund based income, reaching Rs 23.9 Bn for the nine-month period ended 30th September 2025.

Net fee and commission income, amounting to Rs 15.6 Bn, saw a robust 20% year-on-year growth, driven by strong performances in key business areas, including advances, cards, trade, operations, and electronic banking services.

The Bank also recorded a total exchange gain of Rs 3.5 Bn during the period, marking a notable turnaround from the exchange loss of Rs 3.5 Bn reported in the same period last year.

For the nine-month period ended 30th September 2025, the Bank recorded a total impairment charge of Rs 2.0 Bn, representing a significant decrease of 62% compared to the corresponding period in 2024.

Notwithstanding a significant 18.9% expansion in the Bank’s loan portfolio during the period under review, impairment charges on loans and advances declined by 27% year-on-year. This reduction was largely attributable to improved credit quality and stronger repayment capacity across the customer base, supported by favorable macroeconomic conditions and an optimistic business outlook.

The Bank conducted a comprehensive assessment of its ISL customer portfolio, recognising tailored provisions in its Financial Statements to reflect the specific credit risk profiles of ISL customers. In line with its prudent risk management policy, the Bank continued to maintain sound collective impairment provisions, ensuring adequate buffers against potential future credit losses. Notably, the core models used for collective provisioning remained consistent with those applied in 2024.

The reversal of Rs 0.8 Bn (2024: charge of Rs 1.1 Bn) relating to credit-related commitments and contingencies reflects the overall improvement in the credit quality of the Bank’s customer base.

An impairment charge of Rs 0.6 Bn was recognised on other financial instruments during the reporting period, primarily attributable to newly acquired investments.

During the reporting period, the Bank’s operating expenses increased by 19% compared to the same period in 2024, primarily driven by higher personnel costs as a result of annual salary revisions as well as key strategic initiatives embarked upon by the Bank requiring an expansion of the Bank’s staff cadre and IT related costs. As expense growth continued to outpace the increase in operating income, the Bank’s cost-to-income ratio (CIR) deteriorated by 240 basis points, reaching 41.3%, compared to 38.9% in the corresponding period of the previous year.

Sampath Bank continued to demonstrate strong financial resilience during the period under review, maintaining capital adequacy well above the minimum regulatory requirements.

Liquidity levels remained robust, with the All-Currency Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) at 249.0% and the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) at 181.2%, compared to 307.4% and 198.7%, respectively, as at year-end 2024.

Sampath Bank’s total assets grew by 10% during the reporting period, reflecting an annualized growth rate of 13%. Total assets reached Rs 1.95 Tn as at 30th September 2025, up from Rs 1.78 Tn reported at the previous year-end. This growth was primarily driven by the expansion of the Bank’s loan portfolio.

During the period, the Bank’s investment portfolio recorded a marginal decline, primarily reflecting the strategic reallocation of funds towards lending growth following the maturity of short-term investment securities.
