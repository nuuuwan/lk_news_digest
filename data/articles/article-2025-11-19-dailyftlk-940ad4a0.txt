Govt. to invest Rs. 150 m to expand residential facilities for prison officers

The Government will invest Rs. 150 million in 2026 to expand and upgrade residential facilities for prison officers, as severe staffing shortages continue to force officers to work beyond their regular duty hours.

The Cabinet of Ministers approved the proposal presented by the Justice and National Integration Minister Harshana Nanayakkara to address what officials describe as an urgent and long-overdue need within the country’s prison system.

Addressing the weekly post-Cabinet meeting media briefing yesterday, Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa said the first phase of the program will prioritise the construction of two new barracks at the Welikada Prison, a new barrack at the Anuradhapura Prison and the modernisation and improvement of sanitary facilities in all existing barracks across every prison institution.

“Many prisons currently lack even minimum accommodation capacity, leaving officers without proper living quarters despite increasing operational demands,” he added.

Dr. Jayatissa said the lack of adequate housing has become a critical concern as prisons continue to grapple with officer shortages.

“Due to the shortage of officers in prisons, many prison officers have to work after their regular working hours, and it has become essential to provide residential facilities for them,” he added.

He noted that the need for expanded and improved residential infrastructure has grown more pressing with rising numbers of remanded and convicted inmates.

“All prisons do not have adequate residential facilities. It’s necessary to modernise the existing residential facilities and construct new residential facilities in places with space,” he added.

Dr. Jayatissa said the Government views the project as essential to strengthening law enforcement, especially as it intensifies efforts to combat drug-related crime and dismantle organised criminal networks.
