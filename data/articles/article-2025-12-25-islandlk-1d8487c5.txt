Inglish Razor steps up to help combat digital violence against women

To mark the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, Inglish Razor, in collaboration with the Rotaract Club of the University of Sri Jayewardenepura, has launched a pivotal social initiative: A Promise for Her (ඇය වෙනුවෙන් පොරොන්දුවක්).

The programme was launched at the university on 25 November, calling on Sri Lanka’s youth, especially the brand’s core audience of ambitious and confident young men, to take an active stand against the alarming rise of digital violence on women.

2024 data show a surge in online abuse in the country, with 59 daily incidents reported, up from 10 in 2019. Over 21,000 cases occur annually, involving image-based abuse, cyber harassment, and impersonation. Experts warn these numbers likely reflect only a fraction of the true scale, as many survivors do not report incidents due to social factors.

The event brought together prominent activists and experts, including renowned psychologist Rishini Bandara, who highlighted the emotional and psychological trauma experienced by victims.

Ravi De Coonghe, Chief Executive Officer of TruVic Consumer, said, “At Inglish Razor, we believe that true boldness goes beyond appearances. In response to this social issue, we are redefining our brand ethos to emphasise that character and integrity are what truly make a person shine, inspiring young men to stand up for violence against women.”
