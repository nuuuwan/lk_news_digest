SLT‑Mobitel calls for public support to keep Sri Lanka connected

SLT‑Mobitel urgently requests the public not to remove or cut the SLT-Mobitel Fibre and Copper cables that may be lying on the ground following the recent extreme weather conditions. These cables are operational even when fallen, and several service disruptions have already been reported throughout multiple cities due to their removal or damage. Safeguarding these cables is vital to ensure uninterrupted communication during the crisis.

At the same time, SLT‑Mobitel extends its gratitude and seeks public cooperation in supporting the dedicated workforce, who are tirelessly helping to restore normal life by clearing roads, removing fallen trees, and tackling debris and other obstacles. Their efforts are essential to national recovery, and community support is imperative to help them carry out the work more effectively.
