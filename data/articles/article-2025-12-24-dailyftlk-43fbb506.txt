Opposition claims CMC control after Budget defeat

Mayor urges councillors to examine conscience, pledges to continue work despite setback

Opposition MP Mujibur Rahman said the Joint Opposition would move to take control of the Colombo Municipal Council following the defeat of its Budget.

Speaking to the media, Rahman said the mayor would be reduced to a figurehead once the Joint Opposition assumes control of the council. He also claimed the Opposition could have taken over the CMC earlier had the Mayoral election been conducted through an open vote rather than a secret ballot.

In response, Colombo Mayor Vraie Cally Balthazar told council members that the Budget vote amounted to a rejection of their own conscience rather than the council’s financial plan. Addressing councillors after the vote, she urged them to reflect on their decision.

Despite the setback, the Mayor said she remained committed to working with CMC members and staff going forward.
