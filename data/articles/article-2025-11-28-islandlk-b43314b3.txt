HSBC recognised as Sri Lanka’s Best Transaction Bank for 2025 by Euromoney

HSBC has been awarded as the Best Transaction Bank in Sri Lanka, at the first-ever Euromoney Transaction Banking Awards for Excellence 2025. This recognition reflects HSBC’s commitment to partner with Corporate & Institutional Banking clients in Sri Lanka to support their international trade and cash management needs. The award is also a powerful endorsement of the Bank’s strategy, underscoring the importance of the role it plays in opening up a world of opportunity for its clients, effectively using HSBC Group’s network, expertise, products and global channel capabilities.

Commenting on the achievement, Mark Surgenor CEO of HSBC Sri Lanka stated, “This win, which is a first in Sri Lanka, is a tribute to the dedication of everyone in our Global Payments Solutions and Global Trade Solutions and Client Service teams in Sri Lanka and our valued clients for their continued trust and partnership. While this is a global accolade, its true meaning is local. It reinforces our continuing commitment to investing in Sri Lanka as we have done so throughout our longstanding presence, supporting businesses, and contributing to the journey towards greater economic prosperity.”

HSBC Sri Lanka was also recognised earlier this year as the Best International Bank in Sri Lanka by Euromoney and by Finance Asia magazines.
