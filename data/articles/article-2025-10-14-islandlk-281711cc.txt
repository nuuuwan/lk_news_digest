AROH … absolutely excellent

The band AROH, described by many as an awesome outfit, will be seen in action at the 31st event everybody is talking about – ‘Dancing Thru The Decades.’

Says Sohan: “The band is absolutely excellent and they will certainly give New Year’s Eve revellers lots to shout about.”

What’s more, I’m told they are working on a special repertoire to create lasting memories for those who will take in the scene at ‘Dancing Thru The Decades,’ on 31st December, at City of Dreams Cinnamon Life Hotel’s state-of-the-art Lumina ballroom.

Over the past few weeks, AROH have been seen in action at several well-known events, including ‘Hearts In Harmony,’ ‘A Night of Elegance and Celebration,’ Long Bar (Water’s Edge), and also at Oktoberfest (25th Oct.).

Music lovers, who have seen AROH do their thing, say the band has the potential to hit the very top soon.
