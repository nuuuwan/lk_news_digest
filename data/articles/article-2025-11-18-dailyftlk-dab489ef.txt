Lanka Spa Association sets new standards for wellness and spa industry

The Lanka Spa Association (LSA) held its national conference, titled ‘Human Wellness 2025,’ on 9 November at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute (SLFI) Colombo.

The event brought together health professionals, legal experts, and industry representatives to discuss the future of Sri Lanka’s wellness and spa sector. The conference was attended by Health Ministry Consultant Family Physician Dr. Pradeep Gunawardhana, SLFI Senior Lecturer and Director Dr. Saman Weerawansa, Arthritis and Neurology Disorders Specialist Dr. W.A. Delini Anne Silva, legal consultant Senior Attorney-at-Law Susantha Gunawardhana, and LSA Chairman B.M.S. Prasanna Munasinghe.

At the event, the Association officially launched its Code of Ethics, Regulations, and Guidelines, which outlines the qualifications required for those seeking to register wellness spas, infrastructure and hygiene standards, staff qualifications, procedures for charging fees, and steps to obtain necessary health certifications.

The code had earlier been handed over to the Health Ministry and later been referred to the Attorney General’s Department. The conference also announced the introduction of the Certificate Level Course in Wellness and Spa, developed jointly by the LSA and the SLFI. The NVQ Level 4-accredited program aims to strengthen professional skills and raise the quality of service in the wellness and spa sector.

The LSA has played a key role in securing recognition for spa operations in Sri Lanka. Its intervention led to the introduction of a national and regional licencing system through the Indigenous Medicine Ministry.

Over the years, the Association has also engaged with the Presidential Secretariat, Health Ministry, Department of Ayurveda, Tourism Ministry, Public Security Ministry, and the Sri Lanka Police to address challenges faced by the industry and highlight its role in promoting wellness tourism and public wellbeing.
