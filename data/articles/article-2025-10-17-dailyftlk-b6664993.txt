Govt. to boost sports tourism

Tourism Minister Vijitha Herath yesterday said the Government will form an operations committee comprising officials from both the public and private sectors to accelerate efforts to promote sports tourism in Sri Lanka.

The decision was made following a meeting at the Tourism Ministry attended by representatives from the Youth Affairs and Sports Ministry, Sri Lanka Cricket, and several national sports federations. The committee will work to attract international visitors through national and international sporting events, including cricket, rugby, and football tournaments.

Officials noted that while Sri Lanka hosts numerous sports events annually, such as marathons, surfing, and cycling, these have yet to be fully leveraged for tourism promotion. The committee will focus on integrating such events into the broader tourism strategy, improving infrastructure, and enhancing global visibility.

Herath said sports tourism is a key component of the Governmentâ€™s long-term tourism plan, adding that the new committee will help shape policy, identify opportunities, and build partnerships to position Sri Lanka as a leading regional destination for sports tourism.
