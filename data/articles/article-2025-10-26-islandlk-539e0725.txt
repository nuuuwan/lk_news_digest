SriLankan Airlines’ overall loss masks 64% cut in core operational deficit

SriLankan Airlines has reported an overall Group loss of LKR 2,735 million for the 2024/25 financial year, a sharp reversal from the LKR 7,925 million profit recorded the previous year. However, analysts confirm the airline’s underlying business health improved dramatically, with the final loss largely attributed to the Sri Lankan Rupee (LKR) failing to deliver the substantial financial gains it had in the prior period.

The airline’s financial statement, which initially appeared to show a massive swing from profit to loss, was clarified by a balance-sheet expert.

The expert noted that while the report appears confusing, it represents a common reporting practice for companies, particularly airlines, carrying significant foreign currency debt.

“They state that the loss was due to reduced currency gain,” the expert told The Island. “The Airline is kind of saying, ‘Ignore the volatile currency numbers. Operationally, we were much better this year; we cut our underlying loss by about two-thirds. The overall reported loss is just a reflection of the fact that the currency didn’t strengthen as much this year to give us a massive financial gain.'”

The airline’s stated reason for the swing was “primarily to a reduced exchange gain.” The expert explained that SriLankan Airlines likely holds large liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, such as the USD.

“When the Sri Lankan Rupee appreciates against the foreign currency, the rupee value of that debt goes down,” he said. “This reduction in the rupee value of the debt is probably recorded as a gain on the income statement, even though no cash has changed hands—it’s an unrealized gain.”

The good news hidden within the report lies in the reduction of the underlying loss- the operational cost before accounting for the volatile currency effects. The underlying loss fell from LKR 18.792 billion to LKR 6.660 billion, signaling a significant improvement in core performance and efficiency.
