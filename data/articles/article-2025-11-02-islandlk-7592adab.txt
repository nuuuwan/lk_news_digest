Emojot hosts Bradford Smith for CX transformation

In September 2025, Emojot, a leader in AI-powered Experience Management, hosted two exclusive executive forums in Colombo, featuring globally recognized CX authority Bradford Smith. The event aimed to accelerate customer experience transformation for top Sri Lankan executives from sectors like hospitality, healthcare, retail, and finance.

Smith presented high-level, actionable insights on leveraging CX to directly drive profitability, loyalty, and long-term brand value. He emphasized that each customer interaction is a critical “moment of truth,” where winning experiences are defined by simplicity, empathy, and design-led thinking.

The forums were designed to foster deep collaboration, moving beyond theory to practical application.

The event’s success underscored the readiness of Sri Lankan enterprises to embrace this CX future and reaffirmed Emojot’s mission to empower organizations. As summarized by Emojot CEO Dr. Shahani Markus, the initiative was about uniting leaders to explore “how AI can make that emotional connection stronger, smarter, and more human.”
