Capacity-building programs for 30 craftsmen from textile industry of Sri Lanka

A 30-member delegation of handloom and powerloom craftsmen from Sri Lanka visited India from 09–15 November 2025 to participate in a specialised Textile Training and Capacity Building Program. The delegation represented both the handloom and powerloom segments of Sri Lanka’s textile industry. The program was organised pursuant to the announcement made by Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi during his recent visit to Sri Lanka in April 2025, offering 700 customised slots annually for Sri Lankan professionals.

The week-long training program was conducted by the Government of India at the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International School of Textiles and Management (SVPISTM), Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu. It featured a comprehensive set of technical and thematic sessions covering the entire textile value chain, including modules on weaving, modern design technologies, marketing, and leadership. These sessions were designed to enhance practical skills, strengthen industry exposure, and build advanced capabilities in design and production.

As part of their experiential learning, the participants undertook site visits to key institutions and industry facilities. These engagements offered valuable insights into contemporary textile ecosystems, production technologies, design development, and modern retail environments.

Beyond professional skill development, the program provided the delegation with broader exposure to India’s textile innovation landscape, industrial best practices, and collaborative opportunities within the sector.

The specialised training program for Sri Lankan textile craftsmen contributed meaningfully to strengthening professional competencies, encouraging knowledge sharing, and deepening institutional linkages in the textile sector between India and Sri Lanka.
