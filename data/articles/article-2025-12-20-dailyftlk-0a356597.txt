Japan provides $ 1 m shelters through IOM in response to Cyclone Disaster

Japanese Ambassador Akio ISOMATA yesterday together with the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) Sri Lanka Chief of Mission Kristin Parco handed over shelters to Disaster Management Centre (DMC) Director (Preparedness) Chathura Liyanarachchi.

This grant assistance through the IOM, valued at $ 1 million, forms part of an emergency grant amounting to $ 2.5 million, which the Government of Japan decided on 16 December to extend to the Government of Sri Lanka in partnership with United Nations organisations, namely the IOM, the World Food Program (WFP), and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF).

Through the IOM, Japan will provide 615 sets of shelters, including kitchen kits, WASH Kits, and bedding kits, for the severely affected households in Kandy, Badulla and Kegalle.

According to Situation Report of Disaster Management Center (DMC) as of 17 December, more than 66,000 persons and 22,000 families are still in safety centres without their own houses. In addition, over 100,000 houses have sustained partial damage, while more than 6,000 houses have been completely destroyed. Under these devastating circumstances, this assistance is expected to provide shelter to those who have lost their homes and to address their urgent living needs.

In his remarks, Ambassador ISOMATA said, “There is still an urgent need for providing safe living space for displaced people as part of essential necessities of their everyday life.” and emphasised, “This assistance reflects the strong bond of trust and friendship between Japan and Sri Lanka, and underscores Japan’s unwavering commitment to supporting the people of Sri Lanka in times of need. Japan stands in full solidarity with the people of Sri Lanka as they face this difficult period.”
