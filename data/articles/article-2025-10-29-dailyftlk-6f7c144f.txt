Cabinet clears Bill to regulate container depot operators and amend licensing laws

The Cabinet of Ministers on Monday approved publishing a new Bill in the Government Gazette and submit the same for Parliament approval.

“The move is aimed at issuing fresh licences for container depot operators and amending the existing licensing laws governing shipping agents, freight forwarders, general operators and container operators,” Acting Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Vijitha Herath said at the weekly post-Cabinet meeting media briefing yesterday.

The decision follows Cabinet approval granted on 18 December 2024 to draft the new legislation and introduce amendments to the Licensing of Shipping Agents, Freight Forwarders, Non-Vessel Operating Common Carriers and Container Operators Act, No. 10 of 1972.

“The Legal Draftsman has completed the preparation of the Bill, which has also received clearance from the Attorney General,” he added.

He said the legal changes aim to strengthen regulatory oversight of shipping and logistics sectors, improve licencing procedures, and ensure compliance with international operational standards for container depot and freight handling operations.
