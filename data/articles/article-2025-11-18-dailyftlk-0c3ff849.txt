Investment Facilitation Forum bridges Korean innovation with Sri Lankan growth

In a progressive step toward strengthening bilateral trade and investment cooperation, the Embassy of the Republic of Korea, in collaboration with the Board of Investment (BOI) of Sri Lanka and the Korean Businessmen’s Association, hosted the “Korea–Sri Lanka Investment Facilitation Forum” on 14 November at Courtyard by Marriott, Colombo.

The forum was graced by the Ambassador of the Republic of Korea Miyon Lee and Industry and Entrepreneurship Development Deputy Minister Chathuranga Abeysinghe.

Abeysinghe stated that the Sri Lankan Government is committed to creating an investment-friendly environment as elaborated in the 2026 Budget Speech and encouraged Korean companies to establish head offices and production centres in the country. He further emphasised the Government’s ambition to develop a South Korean hub in the port city, enhancing opportunities for Korean investors and deepening bilateral collaborations.

Representing the Korean business community, the event brought together Korean Businessmen’s Association Chairman Yeunkook Chung, Vice Chairman Park Sung Kun, and KOTRA Director Lee Kyungseok who moderated the sessions. From the Sri Lankan side, BOI Chairman Arjuna Herath and Director General Renuka M. Weerakone led the discussions.

The forum convened Korean business representatives and more than twenty Sri Lankan line ministries. It provided a platform for Korean businesses operating in Sri Lanka to highlight the challenges and procedural bottlenecks encountered in their day-to-day operations. Additionally, prospective Korean investors were able to raise concerns and gain insights into entering the Sri Lankan market. The dialogue aimed to enhance the investment climate and strengthen economic cooperation between the two countries.

In her closing remarks, Ambassador Lee expressing her appreciation to all participants highlighted that while Korea recognises the Government of Sri Lanka has made meaningful progress in creating a more investor- friendly system, there remains room for improvement, particularly in the areas of policy clarity, transparency and timely decision making.

The Korea- Sri Lanka Investment Facilitation Forum 2025 concluded on a positive note, reaffirming the shared commitment for both nations to deepen economic ties and create an enabling environment for future investment. The Embassy of the Republic of Korea and the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka expressed their readiness to continue collaborative efforts to strengthen bilateral cooperation and unlock new opportunities for sustainable growth.
