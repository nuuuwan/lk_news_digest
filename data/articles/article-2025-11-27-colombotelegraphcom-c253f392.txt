Model Practices For Preventing Narcotics & Mobile Phone Entry In Correctional Institutions

The UN Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners (the Nelson Mandela Rules) and national prison laws say that correctional facilities must find a careful balance between security, following the law, and treating people who are not free in a fair way. Keeping drugs and unauthorised cell phones out of the facility is an important part of keeping the place safe, protecting staff, the well-being of inmates, and the integrity of the justice system.

In many places, both regionally and globally, institutions that are good at controlling contraband have great leaders, operations based on intelligence, a layered infrastructure, disciplined work practices, and legal, humane procedures. Below, these practices are examined with more explanation and in line with international standards.

Aligned with UNODC Prison Management Framework & ICPA Leadership Standards

Effective security environments are shaped primarily by the quality of leadership. Institutions that maintain superior control over narcotics and mobile phone entry demonstrate:

* Senior management makes sure that departmental guidelines, national prison laws, and human rights requirements are strictly followed.

* The leadership establishes a clear security philosophy that emphasises zero tolerance for contraband and is upheld by appropriate and legal measures.

* Middle-level managers translate strategy into operational performance, ensuring procedures match national rules and maintain recorded accountability.

* Officers at all levels understand their legal duties, including maintaining safe environments under prison acts and regulations.

* Officers practice vigilance, restraint, and ethical conduct—consistent with the Nelson Mandela Rules, which require staff to act professionally and respect human dignity.

* Regular briefing, debriefing, and training reinforce expectations and strengthen institutional culture.

Leadership determines the moral climate of an institution. Where leaders demonstrate fairness, consistency, discipline, and integrity, contraband networks struggle to survive.

Consistent with UNODC “Technical Guide on Prison Security and Safety”

A single measure cannot prevent contraband. High-performing institutions use a multi-barrier security model, where each layer compensates for weaknesses in another. This aligns with the legal requirement to maintain order and safety while upholding proportionality and dignity.

* Surveillance systems, motion detection, patrols, and secure physical barriers.

* Prevents external throwing, drone-assisted deliveries, and perimeter access attempts.

* Searches and supervision during hospital visits, court transfers, work details, and external movements.

* Ensures that movement opportunities are not exploited for smuggling.

* Screening procedures (scanners, metal detectors, bag checks) aligned with national law.

* Visitor registers, biometrics, and CCTV ensure transparency and protect staff integrity.

This mirrors models used in Singapore Prison Service, UK HM Prison Service, Canadian Correctional Service, and US Federal Bureau of Prisons.

Aligned with Nelson Mandela Rules (Disciplinary Framework), CPT Standards, National Law

Disciplinary measures must be proportionate, lawful, documented, and reviewable. They must protect institutional order without violating detainee rights.

* Temporary movement or reallocation to maintain safety and order

* Revision or restriction of visits based on risk (never as punishment)

* Filing of institutional reports in compliance with national laws

* Ensuring the inmate’s access to due process and, where applicable, legal counsel

These steps ensure both operational integrity and human-rights compliance, reinforcing institutional legitimacy.

Global Benchmark: ICPA “Technology in Corrections”, UNODC Digital Security Guidelines

Modern correctional systems rely heavily on advanced detection technology, which significantly reduces contraband inflow and strengthens lawful enforcement.

* Globally recognized as the most effective tool for detecting concealed contraband

* Managed cellphone signal control (preferred internationally over crude jamming)

Technology is effective only when combined with procedural discipline, legal safeguards, and a trained, ethical workforce.

Correctional institutions committed to legal compliance and professional standards can significantly reduce narcotics and mobile phone entry by integrating:

These practices reflect global best-performing correctional systems and provide a scalable, nationally adaptable modelfor strengthening institutional safety, reducing contraband-related violence, and promoting an orderly, rights-respecting correctional environment.

By adopting these standards, institutions can ensure improved security outcomes without compromising dignity, legality, or professional ethics, demonstrating a strong and modern correctional administration aligned with global expectations.
