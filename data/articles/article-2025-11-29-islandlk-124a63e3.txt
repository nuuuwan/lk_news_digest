National Savings Bank Group Posts Strong 3Q 2025 Growth with 30% Surge in Profit Before Tax to Rs. 34.8 billion

National Savings Bank Group (NSB) reported a solid performance for the nine months ended 30 September 2025, delivering sharp improvements in profitability, margins and asset quality despite a moderating interest-rate environment. The state-owned savings giant recorded a Profit Before Tax (PBT) of Rs. 34.8 billion, up 30%, while Profit After Tax (PAT) surged 32% to Rs. 21.2 billion.

Chairman Dr. Harsha Cabral PC said the results highlight the Bank’s ability to uphold its dual mandate of safeguarding national savings and supporting state financing, while maintaining strong profitability. General Manager/CEO Shashi Kandambi noted that disciplined balance-sheet management, improved margins and sustained investments in technology and staff contributed to the strong performance.

Despite a slight moderation in total income due to lower market rates, core profitability strengthened significantly. A 15.8% reduction in interest expenses, driven by active liability management, led to an 16.8% increase in Net Interest Income (NII) to Rs. 64.4 billion.

Operating expenses increased due to wage adjustments and digital investments, but the cost-to-income ratio remained steady at 38.28%, demonstrating solid cost control. After absorbing financial service levies of Rs. 10.6 billion (VAT and SSCL) and an income tax expense of Rs. 13.6 billion that rose in line with higher earnings, NSB delivered a Profit After Tax (PAT) of Rs. 21.2 billion a strong year-on-year increase of over 32%.

This robust bottom-line performance was supported by a dramatic improvement in asset quality and an exceptionally fortified capital base. Strengthened balance sheet and sound liquidity

NSB’s total assets rose to Rs. 1.87 trillion, up 5.3% from end-2024, supported primarily by increased investments in government securities. Loans and advances stood at Rs. 519 billion, marginally lower due to selective lending efforts.

Customer deposits increased to Rs. 1.59 trillion, reaffirming strong depositor confidence. Liquidity remained a standout strength, with the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) exceeding 349% and the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) at 195%, all far above regulatory requirements.

During the period, NSB contributed over Rs. 24.1 billion in taxes on financial services and income tax, reinforcing its role as a key supporter of public finance, in addition to the Bank’s ongoing role as a major investor in government securities and a conduit for funding to key state-owned enterprises.

The Chairman, Dr Cabral noted that NSB will continue expanding access to financial services through its island-wide branch network and over 4,000 postal banking outlets. The General Manager/CEO, Ms Kandambi added that the strong 3Q performance provides a firm foundation for the Bank’s continued focus on digital banking, sustainable growth and enhanced governance.
