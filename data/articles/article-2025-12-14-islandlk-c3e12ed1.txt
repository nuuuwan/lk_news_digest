Kapruka posts 77% operating growth as platform strategy accelerates

Kapruka Holdings PLC reported a 77% year-on-year improvement in operating performance for the quarter ended September 30, 2025, marking a second consecutive quarter of strong results. This surge was driven by disciplined execution and the accelerating momentum of its platform transformation strategy.

The Group achieved 12% year-on-year revenue growth and a 19% increase in gross profit. The central driver is Kapruka Partner Central, which is shifting the company from an inventory-led e-commerce model to a scalable, asset-light platform. By onboarding third-party sellers, Kapruka expands its product range without stock-holding costs, enhancing capital efficiency.

Building on this foundation, Kapruka is launching a Services Platform within Partner Central, enabling online booking of everyday services and entering a new market segment. Simultaneously, its Cross Border initiative acts as an e-distributor for Sri Lankan brands on global marketplaces like Amazon, strengthening USD revenue.

Chairman & CEO Dulith Herath attributed the results to a focused platform mindset, noting Partner Central is creating better outcomes for customers, partners, and shareholders.
