Rakuten Symphony and SLT-MOBITEL partner for open RAN trial in Sri Lanka

Rakuten Symphony and SLT-MOBITEL have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to deploy one of South Asia’s first Open Radio Access Network (Open RAN) trials in Sri Lanka. The pilot project will build 4G and 5G sites using Rakuten Symphony’s advanced Open RAN portfolio.

This initiative is a precursor to a potential nationwide deployment, aimed at enhancing SLT-MOBITEL’s network agility, efficiency, and scalability. It is part of a broader strategic effort by Rakuten, supported by the Japanese government, to accelerate global Open RAN adoption and diversify the telecom supply chain.

Sharad Sriwastawa, President of Rakuten Symphony, stated the partnership will help SLT-MOBITEL achieve a lower total cost of ownership and faster time to market. Sudharshana Geeganage, Chief Operating Officer of Mobitel, said the trial demonstrates SLT-MOBITEL’s commitment to next-generation technologies to support Sri Lanka’s digital economy growth and deliver superior customer value.
