Sri Lanka Insurance Life, has partnered with the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) to introduce the Sri Lanka Insurance Life Rakawarana Retirement Plan, an exclusive retirement plan designed for the legal community.

This special collaboration brings together two prestigious national institutions in a partnership aimed at strengthening the financial security of the legal professionals. The Sri Lanka Insurance Life Rakawarana Retirement Plan is crafted exclusively for members of the BASL, offering a guaranteed income after retirement and enhanced protection with an Accidental Death Cover. It enables members to enjoy a financially independent and peaceful retirement, ensuring that they and their loved ones remain protected at all times.

The plan provides members the flexibility to choose their preferred retirement age between 45 and 70 years, offering a guaranteed monthly income that increases by 5% annually on a compounding interest basis. It also allows members to enhance their retirement fund according to their future needs and to receive up to five times their monthly pension as a health benefit each year, without the need for hospital or medical bills. In the event of an unfortunate demise of the policyholder during the benefit receiving period, the beneficiary will continue to receive the remaining annuity and bonuses.

Adding further protection, the plan offers Accidental Death Coverage to ensure financial support against unforeseen incidents, along with flexible payment options, monthly, quarterly, half-yearly, or annually. The plan is open to individuals between 18 to 60 years of age, with policy terms ranging from 5 to 40 years. Members may also enhance their cover with additional benefits such as family protection covers, permanent disability covers, critical illness covers, and hospitalisation cash benefits.
