Food prices drive October inflation uptick, posing dilemma for policymakers

Sri Lanka’s headline inflation accelerated in October 2025, according to the latest Weekly Economic Indicators Report from the Central Bank, driven by a sharp increase in food prices.

The National Consumer Price Index (NCPI) based headline inflation, measured year-on-year, rose to 2.7% in October, up from 2.1% in September. A breakdown of the figure reveals that Food inflation surged to 4.1%, while Non-Food inflation was a more modest 1.5%.

Meanwhile, core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy items, also saw an increase. It accelerated to 2.1% in October from 1.9% the previous month, suggesting a broadening of price pressures within the economy.

The report comes amid mixed signals from other sectors. While Purchasing Managers’ Indices indicated an expansion in manufacturing and services activities in October, the stock market saw a downturn by November 21, with the All Share Price Index (ASPI) decreasing by 2.03%.

External factors also present a complex picture. While global crude oil prices saw a net decline in the third week of November, the Sri Lankan rupee has depreciated by 5.1% against the US dollar year-to-date, a factor that can contribute to future import costs and inflationary pressure.

The data indicates that while the economy continues to show signs of growth, managing the uptick in inflation, particularly in essential food items, will be a key focus for policymakers in the coming months.

Economic analysts suggest that the Central Bank may view the current uptick in inflation as a necessary, delicate part of the economic normalisation process. “After a prolonged period of deflation or very low inflation, a moderate and controlled return of price pressures can actually be a sign of recovering demand,” an independent economic analyst told The Island.

“The Central Bank was anticipating this shift. By avoiding an overtightening of monetary policy, they are allowing the economy some room to grow. This “controlled” inflation helps businesses regain pricing power, supports corporate earnings, and can encourage consumer spending ahead of further price increases, all of which are vital for sustaining the economic recovery,” he stated.

However, he cautioned that these economic theories offer little comfort to the ordinary man on the street, who feels the immediate pinch of rising prices for essential goods.
