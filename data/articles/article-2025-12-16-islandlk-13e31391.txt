A Classic Christmas

A Classic Christmas with Billy & Devashrie, which was originally scheduled for 6th December, and postponed, will now be held this coming Sunday, 21st December.

The venue remains the same – Musaeus College Auditorium – and the action will commence at 7.00 pm

The organisers say that tickets sold for the originally date are valid for the new date, and the reserved seats remain the same — no action required if you plan to attend.

However, due to unavoidable circumstances you cannot attend and would like a refund, you are requested to email to: bfeshowbiz@gmail.com or call 0773 619090.

The organisers also indicated that profits from this concert will be utilised for helping families affected by the recent floods.

A Classic Christmas will bring into the spotlight Billy Fernando and Devashrie de Silva together with a lineup of some versatile leading musicians, along with feature spots by 2FORTY2, the Methodist College Choir, and an all-girl vocal ensemble MAYA.
