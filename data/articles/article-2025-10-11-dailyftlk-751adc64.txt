CID handles over 20,000 investigations – Dr. Jayatissa

Ensures investigations progressing steadily after several individuals linked to underworld networks arrested

Govt. accuses those involved not only murderers and shooters, but also those who gave them political shelter and directives

The Government is facilitating the authorities to investigate all past crimes and the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) is currently managing an overwhelming caseload of over 20,000, Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa said.

Addressing the post-Cabinet press briefing early this week he said the National People’s Power (NPP) Government took over a country that had a high record of crimes.

“According to my information there are over 20,000 investigations that have been initiated or are to be initiated by the CID. They are working around the clock and if they are to investigate all those cases, we have to have another four to five CIDs,” he said, noting that investigating all those crimes in a short span of period is impossible.

However, Dr. Jayatissa said that investigations were progressing steadily, particularly following the arrest of several individuals linked to underworld networks.

“Those involved in these crimes are not only the murderers and shooters, but also those who gave them political shelter and directives. Among them are those who have returned to power again and again,” he said.

He said uncovering evidence from older cases, especially those dating back to 2012, had been challenging due to the lack of technical evidence available at the time but the investigators are taking all efforts to continue with those investigations.

“Re-exposing concealed evidence is a difficult journey,” he said. “But the officers are working very hard, and the Government is providing full support to ensure justice is served.”
