Govt. addressing shortage of dialysis needles – Health Minister

Health Minister Nalinda Jayatissa informed Parliament yesterday that steps are underway to resolve the shortage of dialysis needles after the initially contracted supplier failed to deliver the required type.

Responding to a question raised by Opposition MP Chamara Sampath Dassanayake, the Minister said the supplier appointed to provide the needles had not supplied the specified type needed for dialysis treatments, causing a temporary shortage in hospitals.

He said the Government has now engaged a new supplier and initiated emergency purchases from alternate sources to ensure continuous treatment for kidney patients. Funds have also been allocated to state and provincial hospitals to make local procurements until normal supplies resume.

According to the Minister, the required consignment of dialysis needles is expected to arrive by 12 October, while stocks for major hospitals and regional Medical Supplies Divisions have already been secured.

“The Medical Supplies Division has opted for local purchasing to address the immediate shortfall after the selected supplier failed to meet specifications,” Jayatissa said.
