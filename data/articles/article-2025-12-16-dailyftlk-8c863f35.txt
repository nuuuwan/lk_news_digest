Sri Lanka Business Council UAE concludes Sri Lanka Expo Pavilion 2025

The Sri Lanka Business Council UAE (SLBC), operating under the Dubai Chamber of Commerce, successfully concluded the Sri Lanka Expo Pavilion 2025 at the Pullman Dubai Creek City Centre, marking a significant milestone in the Council’s 35-year history. The two-day event received an exceptional response from exhibitors and visitors alike, with many participants describing it as one of the most impactful and well-curated Sri Lankan showcases ever held in the UAE. Exhibitors reported strong enquiries, meaningful business leads, and confirmed sales, highlighting the quality and relevance of the visitors who attended.

The Expo Pavilion was officially opened by Ambassador of Sri Lanka to the UAE Prof. Arusha Cooray, together with the Consul General Alexis Gunasekara. They were joined by Special Guests of Honour Farook Kassim and Gamini Kannangara, both eminent senior advisers to the SLBC Board, alongside Rusan Fyroze and Dr. Nishan Silva. Breaking traditional norms, all the ladies present were invited to light the oil lamp at the opening ceremony, symbolising inclusivity and the vital role of women in business and community leadership. The ceremony and program were hosted by well-known Sri Lankan media personality Danu, whose presence added warmth and vibrancy to the event.

SLBC Chairman Suren Swaminathan described the Expo as a new chapter in the Council’s growth story, emphasising the importance of creating curated platforms that bring together relevant industry experts, other country business groups, and potential investors. He thanked the SLBC members who worked tirelessly to support exhibitors, noting that the Council would continue directing serious visitors towards the stalls, but that it was ultimately up to the exhibitors to actively engage potential clients, build relationships, and convert opportunities. He also reminded participants not to judge visitors by their attire, remarking that some of the most valuable deals often come from unexpected conversations.

Ambassador Prof. Arusha Cooray expressed her appreciation to all exhibitors for their confidence and participation, assuring them that the Embassy’s doors were always open to support trade, investment, and commercial engagement. Consul General Alexis Gunasekara reiterated the Government of Sri Lanka’s commitment to strengthening export performance and highlighted that exhibitions of this nature help open new avenues for Sri Lankan products and services in international markets.

One of the distinctive strengths of the Expo was its carefully curated structure, with only one participant representing each industry segment. This unique format ensured exhibitors had complete visibility and no internal competition, creating a focused environment for business engagement. Among the exhibitors were Sergia Holidays, DFCC Bank, Impact IT, Deo International Food & Beverages, Silani Oud, Port City Colombo (China Harbour Engineering), Prime Land Group, and Dilmah Tea.

The Expo’s official hospitality partner, Pullman Dubai Creek City Centre, played a vital role in enhancing the visitor experience by offering authentic Sri Lankan cuisine throughout the event, allowing guests to enjoy the flavours of Sri Lanka while engaging with exhibitors. Siraj Finance supported the Expo as the Platinum Sponsor, contributing significantly to the overall execution and success of the event.

The overwhelming feedback from exhibitors and visitors affirmed the SLBC’s vision of positioning Sri Lankan enterprises at the forefront of opportunity in the UAE. Many exhibitors have already confirmed their intention to participate in the next edition, reflecting the exceptional outcomes and lasting connections formed during the two days. The Sri Lanka Expo Pavilion 2025 has once again underscored the SLBC’s commitment to elevating Sri Lankan business, strengthening bilateral ties, and showcasing the nation’s finest industries on the global stage.
