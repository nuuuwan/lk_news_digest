POIA’s AGM drives a point: The case for revisiting Sri Lanka’s oil palm ban

The Annual General Meeting of the Palm Oil Industry Association (POIA), held at Cinnamon Grand Colombo on Nov. 24, served as an insightful platform to challenge the prevailing narrative surrounding oil palm in Sri Lanka. The keynote address by Dr. Ranjith Mahindapala, a past president of the National Academy of Sciences, presented a compelling, evidence-based case to lift the industry’s controversial ban.

The 2021 government ban was enacted in response to public dissatisfaction, fueled by claims that oil palm is an environmental villain – accused of guzzling water, degrading soil, and causing deforestation, Dr. Mahindapala recalled.

He argued that this decision was a reaction to vociferous, unsubstantiated voices rather than scientific fact.

He presented findings from an independent, comprehensive study by Solidaridad that systematically debunks these myths one by one. The allegation of excessive water use? The independent Solidaridad study reveals water consumption is around 300 litres per day, often met by ample rainfall in the Southern Province.

The fear of high soil erosion? Oil palm is not planted on slopes over 40%, as per official guidelines from the Coconut Research Institute.

Concerns over fertiliser and chemicals? The nutrient need is about twice, not ten times, that of rubber, and pest issues are comparable to coconut.

The economic argument for oil palm is even more striking, he argued.

“Sri Lanka imports a staggering 180,000 to 220,000 MT of palm oil annually, draining vital foreign exchange. Merely 50,000 hectares of domestic cultivation could make the nation self-sufficient in vegetable oil. Furthermore, the crop offers superior financial returns up to ten times higher than rubber and directly benefits the workforce, with monthly wages for oil palm workers significantly exceeding those in rubber or tea estates. Its contribution to GDP already outpaces other plantation crops,” he pointed out.

“The existing policy, which mandates replacing oil palm with rubber, is counterproductive. It replaces a high-yield, economically superior crop with a less profitable one, ultimately weakening the rural economy,” he noted.

Dr. Mahindapala’s appeal was clear: Sri Lanka must transition to evidence-based policymaking. The ban should be lifted and replaced with science-led best practices to ensure environmental sustainability. He further proposed that policymakers visit Malaysia and Indonesia to witness firsthand that the local fears are largely unfounded.

In conclusion he said,” It is time to see oil palm not as a threat, but as a key to agricultural prosperity and import substitution.”
