11 killed in Sydney attack at Jewish event

A mass shooting at Bondi Beach in the Australian city of Sydney yesterday has killed at least 11 people and wounded 29, including two Police officers, Police say.

One man believed to be one of the shooters has also been killed, while a second alleged shooter is in critical condition. Authorities designate the shooting a “terrorist” incident, saying it was “designed to target Sydney’s Jewish community on the first day of Hanukkah.” Hundreds of people had gathered at the beach for an event called Chanukah by the Sea, which was celebrating the start of the Jewish festival.

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese condemned the “targeted” attack, saying the evil that was unleashed was “beyond comprehension.”

UN Secretary-General António Guterres said he is “horrified” by the “heinous” shooting. “I am horrified and condemn [yesterday’s] heinous deadly attack on Jewish families gathered in Sydney to celebrate Hanukkah,” he posted on ‘X.’ “My heart is with the Jewish community worldwide on this first day of Hanukkah.”
