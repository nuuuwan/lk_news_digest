Strengthening Sri Lanka’s Disaster Management Systems

Sri Lanka has just endured one of the most severe natural disasters in its recent history. Cyclonic winds, widespread floods, landslides and large-scale disruptions to daily life have affected every district across the island. Government agencies, the security forces and the Disaster Management Centre responded quickly, while community groups stepped in to provide meals and emergency assistance where needed.

This crisis has revealed an important truth: disasters of this scale cannot be managed by the government alone. The country’s longstanding traditions of social solidarity and volunteerism will be essential to recovery efforts.

However, the events of the past week also highlight weaknesses in Sri Lanka’s existing disaster management arrangements. At present, much of the response appears to be activated only after a disaster has struck. This reactive approach creates delays in coordination, mobility, and the identification of the most vulnerable households.

What is needed is a system that operates continuously—before, during and after an emergency. Local-level volunteer units, equipped with training, tools and rapid communication links to police and ambulance services, would significantly strengthen preparedness. Experience gained through responding to smaller, localised events such as flash floods, fires, storms, road accidents and landslides can also help build capacity for national-level emergencies.

International models offer lessons. In Australia, the State Emergency Service (SES) is a trained volunteer force operating year-round. It responds to a wide range of emergencies—from road accidents to search-and-rescue operations—and works in close coordination with fire, police and ambulance services. Personnel and equipment can be deployed across states when major events occur.

Such a system gives the public confidence that help is available at any hour, and it reduces the need for political intervention except during major national disasters. The security forces are called upon only as a last resort. Clear lines of authority, sufficient resources and properly trained civilian emergency units are central to this model’s success.

Sri Lanka, too, must draw lessons from the current crisis. One key issue is communication: how can agencies coordinate when telecommunications fail? Another is logistics: how can essential goods be delivered when roads and railways are damaged? Air services may offer the most reliable option during severe weather events, underscoring the long-recognised need for an airport in Kandy to service the central region. Infrastructure planning, including expressways, must also consider the realities of flood-prone terrain.

For now, the priority is to support affected communities and ensure their immediate safety and wellbeing. The welfare of animals must also not be forgotten. Despite the scale of the devastation, Sri Lankans have consistently shown courage, resilience and generosity. With support from home and abroad, the country will meet this challenge and recover with strength.
