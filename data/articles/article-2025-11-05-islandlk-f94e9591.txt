Awakening a Generation: Mentoring Sri Lanka’s Youth for Purpose and Progress

One of my students, who is very close to the age of 25, met me and asked about how he could expand his online clothing business in terms of different marketing strategies. With his expertise, inspiration, and interest, I have seen an enamors potential in him to become one of the successful entrepreneurs in Sri Lanka, bringing pride to the nation. In the same discussion, I inquired about a few of his friends of the same age, who were my students in the recent past and whom I could mentor in the future for entrepreneurship, given their potential. He mentioned that most of them are currently not engaged in any employment and are still dependent on their parents’ income. I always think there is a need for proper mentoring for our young people in Sri Lanka. We have many talents in this nation, and, unfortunately, this has not been properly tapped by the country. Additionally, we have also seen many problems that need to be avoided in the long run. Over the last few years, we have witnessed an uprising of many young people across different countries worldwide. The same can be seen in Sri Lanka . Many reasons can be highlighted as causes for those movements, such as corruption, nepotism, etc. People always believe in having a better life with equity. Anyway, the genuine causes for the movements can be seen to have been converted to violence, which needs to be carefully analysed.

Recently, we have seen a series of events that led to political upheaval in Nepal, including widespread protests, the collapse of the government, and the appointment of an interim Prime Minister. Most of the reports and news reported this as “Gen Z protests.” First, we need to understand what Generation Z is and some attributes of this segment. Born between 1997 and 2012, Generation Z represents the first truly “digital native” generation—raised not just with the internet, but immersed in it. Their lives revolve around digital ecosystems: TikTok sets cultural trends, Instagram fuels discovery, YouTube delivers learning, and WhatsApp sustains peer communities. This constant, feed-driven engagement shapes not only how they consume content but how they think, act, and spend.Tech-savvy and socially aware, Gen Z holds brands to a higher standard. For them, authenticity, transparency, and accountability—especially on environmental and ethical issues—aren’t marketing tools; they’re baseline expectations.

A recent CNN report from Nepal highlights how Generation Z, long described as “digital natives,” is now transforming that online fluency into political force. Frustrated by corruption and emboldened by connectivity, young protesters organised through Instagram, Discord, and other networks—even under state attempts to silence them with internet shutdowns. Their mass mobilisation led to violent clashes, resulting in many deaths and destruction.

Anyway, we need to understand the fact that there should be proper education on certain aspects of life that are not being absorbed in current settings. McKinsey Health Institute’s global survey (42,083 people in 26 countries) finds Gen Z reports poorer mental health than older cohorts and are more likely to say social media harms them, especially those spending 2+ hours daily. According to a report by The Diplomat (Sept. 2025), Nepal’s Gen Z–led uprising marks a turning point in South Asian youth activism. Sparked by a temporary social media ban and decades of elite corruption, young Nepalis mobilised rapidly—translating digital fluency into street protests that toppled a sitting government. The Diplomat emphasises a critical truth behind Nepal’s Gen Z–led protests: while their decentralised, app-driven organising showed impressive speed and coordination, true change requires more than digital momentum. The resignation of Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli may signal victory, but without deep institutional reform, core issues—like corruption, weak youth representation, and fragile democratic structures—remain unresolved. The danger, as The Diplomat warns, is that the movement may become a fleeting symbol rather than a force for lasting change. Its legacy could be reduced to striking visuals and viral moments—powerful, yes, but ultimately lacking in structural impact.

In reflecting on Nepal’s Gen Z uprising, Sri Lankan youth—beyond just Gen Z—must also turn inward and ask a deeper question: Do we truly understand our own national identity? Amid the digital noise and global influences, there is a growing disconnect from Sri Lanka’s cultural roots, values, and ethical foundations. This is precisely why Sri Lanka must look inward and revive movements grounded in national purpose—much like those once led by Ven. Madihe Pannasiha Mahanayake Thera. He founded the Dharma Vijaya Foundation with the vision of transforming Sri Lanka into a Dhamma Dīpa—a nation guided by compassion, wisdom, and moral discipline. At a time of growing youth disillusionment, his Thurunu Saviya movement offered a lifeline: a platform for youth rehabilitation, leadership, and moral development, particularly in response to rising drug abuse and social unrest. His fearless advocacy helped shape national policy—from making Poya days public holidays to protecting Buddhist schools and heritage, reinforcing the role of cultural identity in nation-building. Ven. Madihe Pannasiha’s legacy reminds us that real transformation demands more than slogans or social media campaigns—it requires rooted leadership, moral courage, and a collective return to values that define us. As Sri Lanka’s youth navigate the noise of global trends and digital distractions, this blend of tradition and action is not just relevant—it’s essential.

We need to understand the balance between novelty and tradition. As Winston Churchill wisely observed, “A love for tradition has never weakened a nation; indeed, it has strengthened nations in their hour of peril”. In today’s fast-scrolling digital world, this message rings louder than ever. Our young people—beyond just Generation Z—should be given good mentoring and direction. We need to get together and have some movement to help our young generation with their talent management by inculcating an entrepreneurial mindset aligned with moral values. I think this is much needed to convert this country into a developed nation.
