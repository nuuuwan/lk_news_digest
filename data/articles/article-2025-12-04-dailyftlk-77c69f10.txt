Harsha says Rebuilding Sri Lanka needs Parliament sanction, oversight

Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Dr. Harsha de Silva called for Parliamentary approval and oversight over the Rebuilding Sri Lanka initiative.

Speaking in Parliament yesterday, he said the proposed Rebuild Sri Lanka Fund cannot be created without the approval of the legislature.

“Parliament has full control over public finance in terms of the Constitution,” he said. He noted that the Public Financial Management Act does not permit statutory funds to be established at will.

“We have no objections to establishing the fund. It must be established as per the Constitution and the Public Financial Management Act,” he told the House.

The Cabinet has already approved the creation of the Fund, which is intended to mobilise resources from both the public and private sectors for the rehabilitation of essential infrastructure, including highways, irrigation systems, and other facilities damaged by the disaster.

A public-private Management Committee has been appointed to administer the Fund, set priorities, allocate resources, and ensure transparency in financial operations. The Committee is chaired by Labour Minister and Deputy Minister of Finance and Planning Dr. Anil Jayantha Fernando, with Senior Additional Secretary to the President G.M.R.D. Aponsu serving as Convenor.

The Management Committee comprises Foreign Affairs, Foreign Employment and Tourism Ministry Director General – Europe and North America Sugeeshwara Gunaratna; Senior Additional Secretary to the President Aponsu; Senior Adviser to the President Duminda Hulangamuwa; Finance, Planning and Economic Development Ministry Secretary Dr. Harshana Suriyapperuma; Western Province Governor Hanif Yusoof; Labour Minister and Deputy Minister of Finance and Planning Dr. Fernando; Hayleys Group Executive Chairman Mohan Pandithage; John Keells Holdings Chairperson and CEO Krishan Balendra; LOLC Executive Chairman Ishara Nanayakkara; Aitken Spence Deputy Chairman and Managing Director Dr. Parakrama Dissanayake; and Brandix CEO Ashroff Omar.
