EXCON positions construction technology as catalyst for sustainability and inclusive growth

EXCON 2025, South Asia’s largest construction equipment exhibition, is returning for its landmark 13th edition from 9 to 13 December, at the Bangalore International Exhibition Centre (BIEC), Bengaluru.

Positioning construction technology as a catalyst for sustainable, inclusive national growth, EXCON champions the evolution of infrastructure projects as advanced and mechanised equipment become essential for timely delivery and world-class quality, said a spokesperson of EXCON.

The spokesperson pointed out that the event underscores the nation’s commitment to long-term infrastructure excellence, as India is building at a pace the world can no longer ignore — from new-age highways and next-generation airports to smart cities. EXCON is supported by India’s Heavy Industry, Road Transport and Highways, and Housing and Urban Affairs, along with sector partner ICEMA.

Industry conferences organised by CII, ICEMA, and BAI will bring together policymakers, CEOs, and global experts to discuss the future of infrastructure machinery, policy alignment, financing models, and new technology integration. This blend of commerce, knowledge exchange, and international partnership makes EXCON more than an exhibition — it is a strategic platform where technology meets trust, and where India invites the world to shape the next century of growth.

EXCON 2025 will showcase over 1,250 exhibitors, including 160 international participants, across 3.5 million sq. ft of display area. Business engagement is expected to reach new heights, with over 100,000 visitors, eight international pavilions representing leading economies including China, Germany, France, Italy, Russia, South Korea, Turkey, and the United Kingdom, alongside participation from more than 25 countries, including Sri Lanka. Visitors can expect over 500 product launches and 5,000 B2B meetings, making Bengaluru the global headquarters for construction innovation over five action-packed days.

India’s infrastructure story is not just about scale but also resilience, environmental stewardship, and community connectivity.
