Bairaha Farms PLC, one of Sri Lanka’s poultry producers, celebrates 50 years of excellence and leadership in reshaping the nation’s nutritional landscape.

When Bairaha commenced operations in 1975, chicken was considered a luxury on the Sri Lankan dining table. Five decades on, Bairaha has been instrumental in making chicken the country’s most accessible and affordable source of protein—a transformation that reflects both the company’s enduring commitment to quality and Sri Lanka’s progress toward food self-sufficiency.

From its humble beginnings pioneering quality chicken processing, large scale parent broiler breeder and broiler farms, as well as in establishing the first Eliza Laboratory for poultry, Bairaha has evolved into one of Sri Lanka’s largest fully integrated poultry producers, encompassing broiler breeder grandparent and parent farms, feed milling, processing, and together with islandwide distribution of chicken products. This integration has enabled the company to uphold consistent quality standards and ensure price stability, even amid economic volatility and supply chain challenges. Alongside, Bairaha’s strong partnerships with rural farmers have helped uplift household incomes and expand the nation’s poultry production base.

Bairaha Farms PLC Managing Director Yakooth Naleem said, “Our 50-year journey has been one of continuous learning, innovation, and adaptation. Amid changing consumer needs and economic challenges, we have remained focused on what matters most, earning trust, maintaining quality, and ensuring that poultry remains accessible to every Sri Lankan household. These values have guided us from strength to strength across generations.”

Reflecting on the future, Naleem added, “Despite challenges such as raw material shortages and rising competition, the growth potential for Sri Lanka’s poultry industry remains strong—both domestically and in export markets. As we move forward, our priority is to build on the trust we’ve earned by continuing to provide safe, affordable poultry while advancing our processes through innovation and sustainability.”

Bairaha’s history is deeply intertwined with the evolution of Sri Lanka’s poultry sector. The company established the country’s first large scale broiler parent breeder farm and hatchery in 1977, followed by a modern processing facility in 1980. A major milestone came in 1985 with the introduction of the Contract Growing Scheme, empowering rural farmers in Gampaha, Puttalam, and Kurunegala Districts to participate in commercial poultry production. This pioneering model, now widely adopted across the industry—created stable livelihoods, strengthened national supply chains, and boosted local agriculture through increased demand for maize and other feed inputs.

Today, Bairaha operates across 13 locations islandwide, supported by over 1,300 employees and hundreds of contract farmers. Each facility, from breeder farms and feed mills to processing and distribution, adheres to stringent quality and operational standards, ensuring that Bairaha products reach retailers and households fresh and reliable, every day.
