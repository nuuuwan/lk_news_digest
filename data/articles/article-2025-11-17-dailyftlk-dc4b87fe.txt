Lanka Coffee Association hosts 4th Annual General Meeting

The Lanka Coffee Association (LCA) held its 4th Annual General Meeting yesterday at the Waters’ Edge Hotel, Battaramulla.

Established in 2021, the LCA represents the collective interests of all stakeholders working to elevate Sri Lanka’s coffee industry to new heights. Among its key initiatives is the Sri Lanka Coffee Festival, organised in collaboration with the Department of Export Agriculture and with the continued support and patronage of Australia’s Market Development Facility (MDF)

This year’s Festival, celebrating 200 years of coffee in Sri Lanka, took place at the Kandy City Centre and attracted over 1,000 visitors. More than 30 companies showcased their products at the Coffee Expo, while the event also featured an awards ceremony recognising outstanding farmers, processors, exporters, and café operators. Other highlights included a school art competition and the official launch of a commemorative 200th-year coffee stamp.

In its efforts to enhance coffee quality, the LCA invited Sunalini Menon, dubbed “Asia’s First Lady of Coffee”, a renowned quality consultant, to conduct a full-day, hands-on training session on post-harvest practices and quality evaluation. Over 20 companies participated in this practical workshop, reflecting the growing professionalism within Sri Lanka’s coffee value chain.

At the AGM, Helanta Coffee and Royalwin Ceylon International Founder and Managing Director Tharanga Muramudali, was elected as the new Chairperson of the LCA, succeeding Colombo Coffee Company CEO Kushan Samararatne, who served two consecutive terms and contributed significantly to the Association’s growth.

The newly appointed executive committee includes M.I. Izzadeen (Elpitiya Plantations) as Vice Chairperson, Ashane Perera (Temple Grounds Coffee) as Secretary, and Shelton Thenuwara (Tree of Life), Binesh Pananwala (Kahawatte Plantations), Asitha de Costa (Thadula Realty & Echo Ventures), and Ushan Dissanayake (GKUC Spicy Port) as Executive Committee Members.

In his remarks, Muramudali stated: “In my 15-year journey as a coffee farmer from the ground up, I have witnessed how much effort it has taken to unite those within our sector, and the formation of the LCA itself is one of the biggest successes of that effort. The two Chairpersons before me laid a strong foundation for us to build on, and over the next two years, I want to bring together all coffee farmers, roasters, baristas, cafés, exporters, and everyone who loves Sri Lankan coffee to create the most efficient and dedicated association possible. We warmly invite all those involved in the sector to join hands with us. I also take this moment to thank everyone who has supported us over the years.”

Housed with the Sri Lanka Agripreneurs’ Forum (SLAF), the LCA secretariat, and the Executive Committee continues its mission to enhance global recognition for Ceylon Coffee, develop industry standards, promote sustainability, and expand the country’s export profile through collective, industry-led action.
