Govt. to launch ‘Ratama Ekata’ national anti-drug operation

The Cabinet of Ministers on Monday approved the establishment of a National Operational Council to implement ‘Ratama Ekata National Operation’ – a rapid-response program aimed at eradicating drug abuse and strengthening rehabilitation efforts through public participation, Cabinet Spokesman and Health Minister Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa said yesterday.

The proposal, submitted by President Anura Kumara Disanayake, was endorsed by the Cabinet to address what the Government described as a serious national crisis caused by the spread of narcotic drugs and the rise in drug-related crimes.

Dr. Jayatissa said the program will be driven by strong political leadership and a coordinated decision-making framework, supported by community engagement.

The “Ratama Ekata” initiative will focus on dismantling drug trafficking networks, improving rehabilitation services, and conducting a nationwide awareness campaign to encourage prevention and recovery.
