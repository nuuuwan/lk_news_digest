CIABOC gets digital Case Tracking System to boost transparency, efficiency

The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) yesterday launched a new digital Case Tracking System aimed at improving transparency, efficiency, and accountability.

CIABOC Chairman Justice Neil Iddawala described the new platform as “a transformative step” that goes beyond a mere technological upgrade. He said the system represents a major shift in how the Commission manages and processes information, records, and case files central to its work.

“Corruption thrives where there is opacity, delay, and inefficiency. Transparency and accountability are the strongest deterrents,” Justice Iddawala said, calling the new system “an instrument of reform” that will strengthen public trust.

The Case Tracking System integrates automation and centralised digital recordkeeping to improve accuracy, enable real-time case monitoring, and streamline workflows. It also introduces data-driven decision-making tools to enhance institutional performance.

The project was implemented with financial assistance from the Government of Japan and technical support from the UNDP.  Addressing CIABOC staff, Justice Iddawala encouraged officers to embrace the new system, noting that it empowers them to work with greater precision and professionalism. “Each keystroke is a contribution to CIABOC’s mission—to build a cleaner, fairer, and more transparent society,” he said.

The launch aligns CIABOC’s operations with international best practices and Sri Lanka’s commitments under the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC).
