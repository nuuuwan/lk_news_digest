OSC earns global recognition for sustainability

The Overseas School of Colombo (OSC) has been globally recognized as a leader in sustainable education. It was featured by UNESCO’s Greening Education Partnership as one of only two exemplary Green Schools worldwide and renewed its prestigious Eco-Schools Green Flag accreditation.

The school’s commitment was highlighted during a significant visit from Dr. Pramod Kumar Sharma of the Foundation for Environmental Education. Students showcased hands-on initiatives, including permaculture gardens harvested for a communal lunch, a bio-gas plant, and composting systems.

These accolades place OSC among an elite group within the 59,000 Eco-Schools network. Student achievements also include winning the international Young Reporters for the Environment competition and leading sessions at UN conferences, confirming OSC’s role as a transformative force in embedding sustainability into education.
