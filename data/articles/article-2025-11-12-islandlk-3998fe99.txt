Dialog and MEPA Unveil Sri Lanka’s First 5G-Enabled Autonomous Water-Surface Cleaning Robot

Dialog Axiata PLC, Sri Lanka’s #1 connectivity provider, in partnership with the Marine Environment Protection Authority (MEPA), under the Ministry of Environment, has unveiled Sri Lanka’s first 5G-enabled autonomous water-surface cleaning robot. Designed to collect floating waste and monitor environmental conditions in real time, this pioneering innovation demonstrates the transformative potential of 5G in enabling intelligent, sustainable solutions that protect Sri Lanka’s waterways and ecosystems.

The robot combines 5G connectivity, AI, and robotics to navigate lakes, rivers, and canals, collecting floating debris such as plastic bottles, bags, and leaves. It can clean 50–100 acres of surface water per mission and collect up to 50 kg of waste per run, preventing plastics from entering the ocean while supporting UN Sustainable Development Goal 14: Life Below Water.

The launch event, held at Beira Lake on 11 November, was graced by Hon. Dr. Dammika Patabendi, Minister of Environment; Mr. Samantha Gunasekara, Chairman – Marine Environment Protection Authority (MEPA); Supun Weerasinghe, Group Chief Executive of Dialog Axiata PLC; and representatives from the Ministry of Environment, MEPA, and Dialog. The event served as a live demonstration of how advanced technologies such as 5G, AI, and robotics can be harnessed to address pressing environmental challenges.

“Initiatives such as this reflect the importance of cross-sector collaboration in achieving our environmental objectives,” said Hon. Dr. Dammika Patabendi, Minister of Environment. “We commend Dialog and MEPA for leveraging technology to support the national mission of protecting Sri Lanka’s waterways and preserving them for generations to come.”

“The 5G-enabled autonomous cleaning robot represents a new frontier in marine conservation and reflects Sri Lanka’s commitment to using innovation for environmental resilience,” said Mr. Samantha Gunasekara, Chairman of the Marine Environment Protection Authority. “We extend our sincere appreciation to Dialog Axiata for partnering with us to bring this pioneering initiative to life — a collaboration that sets an inspiring example of how technology and collective effort can drive a cleaner, more sustainable future.”

Enabled by ultra-low latency of Dialog’s 5G network, the robot offers real-time HD video streaming, and remote controlling over the network, allowing operators to guide it remotely from anywhere in the country. Its AI-based garbage detection, obstacle avoidance, and centimetre-level positioning ensure efficient and safe operations, powered entirely by a carbon-neutral electric system.

“This is a powerful example of how 5G can serve a purpose far greater than connectivity,” said Supun Weerasinghe, Group Chief Executive of Dialog Axiata PLC. “We are proud to collaborate with MEPA and national institutions in applying next-generation technology to address environmental challenges, reflecting our shared vision of building a smarter, greener, and more sustainable Sri Lanka.”

By combining 5G, AI, and sustainability, Dialog continues to redefine the role of innovation in safeguarding the environment — paving the way for smarter, greener, and more resilient urban ecosystems across Sri Lanka.
