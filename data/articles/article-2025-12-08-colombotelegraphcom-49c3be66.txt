Reawakening Accountability In Sri Lanka’s Public Institutions

When I wrote my article for the Colombo Telegraph on 29 September titled “Hopefully, President AKD Now Sees Why the Public Service Is Slow,” my central argument was clear: Sri Lanka’s progress depends not only on political leadership but equally on the efficiency, responsiveness, and accountability of its public institutions.

President Anura Kumara Dissanayake had already acknowledged the sluggishness within the public service, identifying several contributory factors. Yet many deeper structural issues remain unaddressed, and the unseen damage inflicted over decades on Sri Lanka’s economic and social development may well be far more extensive than what recent events have revealed.

Environmental scientist Dr Asoka Perera, in a recent interview, attributed the scale of the current disaster largely to institutional unpreparedness. ( https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1RBzzUxGPX/ ) Adding to this, the Editor of Colombo Telegraph revealed on his Facebook page that crucial information had reached authorities two hours before the tsunami hit the country two decades ago — ( https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1Fc6zFqCdm/ ) yet no warning was issued. These lapses are not historical footnotes; they are symptoms of a recurring institutional failure.

These are not isolated incidents. They reflect a long-standing pattern in how many public offices in Sri Lanka have operated: slow, uncoordinated, indifferent, and structurally resistant to reform. Unless a crisis makes these faults visible, the country quietly suffers while politicians — regardless of their intent — end up taking the blame.

A simple personal example shows just how deep the problem runs. The writer was recently informed that he would likely have to drive with a temporary driving license for nearly two years before receiving the proper license  from the Department. Two years — for a routine administrative document in 2025. Why? No one can provide an answer. Something is fundamentally wrong, yet no one seems to care.

This is not a mere inconvenience; it is emblematic of an institutional culture where processes drag on indefinitely and responsibility evaporates entirely. And this is just one item in a long list of public service dysfunctions that leave citizens frustrated and helpless.

To be fair, President AKD continues to enjoy substantial public goodwill, largely because he and many in his team are seen as maintaining clean records. In a country weary of corruption scandals, this reputation matters. But goodwill alone cannot reform institutions. Integrity must be paired with decisive action, modern systems, and a renewed ethos of responsibility across every department.

The task before the Government extends far beyond responding to a single disaster or strengthening disaster management. Sri Lanka needs a fundamental reset in how every State institution operates — from regulatory authorities and environmental agencies to administrative departments, planning bodies, and frontline service providers. The future depends on institutions that communicate effectively, make timely decisions, and execute without delay or excuses. Above all, they must understand that public service ultimately means serving people.

What Sri Lanka urgently needs is a culture where every public institution fully owns its mandate — whether issuing licenses, managing the environment, addressing public complaints, approving development plans, or supporting vulnerable communities. When agencies embrace their responsibilities with clarity and urgency, the entire public system begins to function as a coordinated, effective whole.

Sri Lanka has always shown remarkable resilience in the face of adversity. But this moment demands more than resilience. The recent disaster should not become just another entry in our long record of challenges. It should instead be the catalyst that finally compels the State to modernise, energise, and restore accountability across the public sector.

If the leadership chooses to seize this moment — not only to address emergency-related weaknesses but to invigorate the entire machinery of government — Sri Lanka can move toward a sharper, faster, and more reliable State apparatus. Should that transformation take place, the nation will emerge not just repaired, but truly renewed.
