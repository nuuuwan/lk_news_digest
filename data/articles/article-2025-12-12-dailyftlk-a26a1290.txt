Cabinet approves recruitment of 2,284 vacant Govt. positions across Ministries and provinces

The Cabinet of Ministers at their meeting on Wednesday approved a major recruitment drive to fill 2,284 vacant positions across various Ministries, Provincial Councils, and other Government entities, following recommendations from a committee headed by the Secretary to the Prime Minister.

The committee was tasked with reviewing the Government’s recruitment processes, identifying priority requirements, and setting timelines for appointments.

The approval comes after detailed submissions from Ministries highlighting critical vacancies in their respective departments.

Among the largest allocations, the Transport, Highways and Urban Development Ministry will recruit 778 personnel, while the Health and Mass Media Ministry is set to fill 480 positions. Other significant allocations include 230 positions for the Western Provincial Council, 222 for the Justice and National Integration Ministry, and 196 for the Education, Higher Education and Vocational Education Ministry.

Smaller allocations have been assigned to Ministries including Defence (73), Trade, Commerce, Food Security and Cooperative Development (107), Agriculture, Livestock, Land and Irrigation (74), and various other Ministries and Provincial Councils, reflecting a comprehensive countrywide recruitment effort.

The initiative is expected to strengthen public administration, improve service delivery, and address operational gaps in key Government sectors.

The committee has emphasised that recruitment will proceed according to assessed needs and priorities to ensure efficiency and effectiveness across Ministries and Departments.
