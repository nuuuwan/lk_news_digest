Sriyani Dress Point, one of Sri Lanka’s leading fashion retail chains, has stepped forward as a responsible corporate citizen by donating Rs. 20 million to the Government’s ‘Rebuilding Sri Lanka’ Fund while simultaneously activating comprehensive ground-level relief operations for communities devastated by Cyclone Ditwah.

The substantial cash donation was presented to Secretary to the President Dr. Nandika Sanath Kumanayake, by Sriyani Dress Point Chairman M. Selvaraj together with the company’s Managing Directors and senior leadership team.

Beyond the financial commitment to national recovery efforts, Sriyani Dress Point immediately mobilised its staff members from its eight showrooms across Sri Lanka to deliver direct, tangible assistance where it was needed most urgently. By leveraging this network and its deep community connections, the company distributed essential aid including clothing and dry rations directly to affected families. This grassroots response ensured that support reached vulnerable communities without delay. The company further amplified its impact through strategic partnerships with humanitarian initiatives led by Sri Lankan media organisations, along with other key organisational collaborations, extending the reach and effectiveness of its relief distribution efforts.
