Customs extends UNCTAD technical assistance for ASYCUDA system till 2027

Sri Lanka Customs will continue to enhance its automated revenue collection system under a renewed agreement with the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD).

The decision was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers on Monday involving signing a sixth addendum to the existing partnership, extending UNCTAD’s technical assistance until June 2027.

The move builds on structural reforms recommended by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in 1991, which emphasised automation in customs processes. Since then, the Sri Lankan Government has relied on the ASYCUDA system, developed and continuously improved by UNCTAD for efficient revenue collection.

Under the renewed agreement, UNCTAD will also conduct two specialised training programs for Sri Lanka Customs staff, focusing on enhancing the functions of the currently used ASYCUDA World system as well as the ASYCUDA and ASYHUB platforms.

Sri Lanka Customs has previously signed five agreements with UNCTAD, leveraging the organisation’s expertise in technical assistance and system development. The latest extension ensures continuity in modernising customs operations and improving automation for faster and more efficient service delivery.

The proposal to this effect was submitted by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake in his capacity as the Finance, Planning and Economic Development Minister.
