John Keells Foundation marks International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women

On the occasion of the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, John Keells Foundation (JKF) reaffirmed its long‑standing commitment to combatting gender‑based violence and child abuse through its flagship initiative, Project WAVE (Working Against Violence through Education).

Since its launch in November 2014, Project WAVE has reached over 5.8 million individuals, including employees of the John Keells Group, specific groups such as police officers, lawyers, university students, schoolchildren, teachers, parents, and the wider public.

This year’s campaign was rolled out under the theme “UNiTE to Take Action Against Violence”, adopting a multi‑pronged approach that included internal awareness creation towards preventing and addressing gender based violence (through both awareness sessions as well as an all staff email campaign), a sustained social media campaign and community awareness programmes scheduled across business locations of the John Keells Group. All activities reinforce practical, proactive and everyday actions that individuals can take to prevent or address violence. A symbolic white ribbonpinning ceremony was also held with senior management and project staff, underscoring solidarity with survivors and commitment to ending violence. In addition, JKF’s internal e‑learning module as adapted for external audiences will soon be launched via the JKF’s e‑learning platform, with plans to extend access to universities and community groups.
