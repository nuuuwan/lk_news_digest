Govt. appoints committee to coordinate foreign aid for disaster-affected

A high-level national committee has been appointed to streamline the coordination and distribution of foreign humanitarian aid sent to support Sri Lankans affected by the recent floods.  The announcement was made by Deputy Defence Minister Major General (Retd.) Aruna Jayasekara during a special media briefing at the Disaster Management Centre (DMC) on Monday.

Jayasekara said the committee will ensure that all relief items and equipment provided by international partners are channelled efficiently and reach the communities most impacted by the disaster. He stressed that maintaining proper oversight and coordination is essential to avoid duplication, delays, or misallocation of urgently needed assistance. The committee, appointed with immediate effect, will be chaired by the Deputy Minister himself.
