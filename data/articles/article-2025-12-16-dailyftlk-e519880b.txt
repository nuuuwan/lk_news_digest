Pushpika Janadheera reappointed SLAMERP Chairman

The Sri Lanka Association of Manufacturers and Exporters of Rubber Products (SLAMERP) has reappointed Dipped Products PLC Managing Director Pushpika Janadheera, as its Chairman at the Association’s 15th Annual General Meeting.

SLAMERP is a leading industry body for Sri Lanka’s value-added rubber products sector, which contributes $ 1 billion in export earnings while strengthening the country’s position as a global supplier of high-quality rubber products. The Association represents manufacturers and exporters in the rubber sector, promotes market expansion, and supports efforts to improve global market access for Sri Lankan products. It also plays a key role in national policy dialogue on issues that influence the stability and long-term growth of the rubber industry.

Under Janadheera’s leadership, SLAMERP has taken clear and proactive positions on challenges faced by the sector. The Association called for immediate Government engagement when the United States announced tariff on Sri Lankan rubber imports, a development that threatened export competitiveness and the livelihoods of thousands of families linked to the rubber value chain. SLAMERP also raised strong concerns regarding the proposed removal of the SVAT scheme, cautioning that the change would create severe cash-flow pressure for SMEs, and exporters unless a tested refund mechanism was in place.

Beyond its advocacy efforts, SLAMERP continues to focus on strengthening local supply chains, increasing raw rubber production, and uplifting smallholder communities that form the foundation of the sector. The Association works closely with the Plantation Industries Ministry, and the Export Development Board to expand market access and support national export objectives aligned with Sri Lanka’s 2030 roadmap.

Janadheera said, “I am honoured by the confidence placed in me by the membership. Our industry is navigating a challenging global environment, which highlights the need for collaboration, innovation, and strategic diversification. SLAMERP remains committed to supporting manufacturers and enhancing the competitiveness of Sri Lanka’s value-added rubber sector.”

Dipped Products PLC Managing Director Janadheera, joined the company in 2017 as Director of Operations and was promoted to Deputy Managing Director in 2020 before taking on his current leadership role in 2023. His career includes senior positions at Richard Pieris Tyre Company and Associated Motorways. He is a Fellow of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka, an Associate Member of CIMA UK, a Chartered Global Management Accountant, and holds a BSc in Accountancy and an MBA from the University of Sri Jayewardenepura.

The AGM also introduced the proposed office bearers for 2026 to 2027, including Dr. Eng. Sisira Ranatunga as Director General, Chinthaka Wegapitiya as Vice Chairman, Channa De Silva as Secretary, and Palika Chandrajeewa as Treasurer.

SLAMERP continues to advocate for the rubber sector, strengthen export competitiveness, and support the communities that depend on this vital
