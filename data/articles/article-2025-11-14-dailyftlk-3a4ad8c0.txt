Sajith showcases ‘Brand Sri Lanka’

Outlines vision for future at SLIM World Marketing Forum 2025

Opposition leader Sajith Premadasa presented Sri Lanka as a country ready to claim its place on the global stage in tourism, trade, investment and innovation at the SLIM World Marketing Forum 2025.

Delivering an energetic and forward-looking address to international gathering of marketing professionals, he highlighted the country’s rapid economic recovery and its unique strengths as a global brand.

Premadasa described Sri Lanka as an island of “everlasting wonder” where nature, culture and hospitality come together in a truly distinctive experience.

He noted the strong resurgence in tourism, with more than two million arrivals in 2024 and revenue rising to $ 3.1 billion. He stressed the importance of improving visitor experiences, strengthening infrastructure and protecting natural heritage so that every traveller leaves as an ambassador for Sri Lanka.

He highlighted record export performance in 2024, with total exports reaching $ 16.7 billion through strong contributions from apparel, tea, spices, rubber products and services. He said the “Made in Sri Lanka” identity has the potential to become a powerful global label rooted in sustainability and quality.

Premadasa also outlined several strategic advantages that he said Sri Lanka must commit to in order to secure long-term competitiveness. These include its ideal location in the Indian Ocean, its maritime and logistics capacity, a talented workforce aligned with global time zones, competitive operating costs, cultural depth and unmatched biodiversity. He said few countries combine beaches, highlands, rainforests, ancient sites and vibrant culture within such a compact landmass.

Inviting global investors to look beyond conventional sectors, he positioned Sri Lanka as an emerging centre for wellness tourism, IT and BPO, renewable energy, logistics, electronics and advanced manufacturing. He said the country must accelerate reforms including streamlined approvals, modernised digital systems for customs and visas, a stable tax environment, stronger commercial courts and policies to attract the global Sri Lankan diaspora.

Premadasa also acknowledged the challenges the nation faces, including rising levels of poverty, and said foreign investment and export-driven growth are essential to lifting families out of hardship. He called for unified action between the Government, private sector and international partners to drive inclusive development.

Presenting his broader vision, the Opposition leader spoke of a future where Sri Lanka becomes a competitive, innovation-driven and sustainably developed country. He envisioned a nation with strong institutions, transparent governance, globally competitive industries, modern infrastructure, expanded exports and equal opportunities for all citizens. He said Sri Lanka can become a dynamic hub in the Indian Ocean that is admired internationally for both its natural beauty and its economic ambition.

Concluding his address, Premadasa said Sri Lanka stands at a decisive moment. He invited the world to visit, trade with and invest in Sri Lanka, expressing confidence that with resilience and collective commitment, the country can become a global example of what a small island nation can achieve through unity, vision and shared prosperity.
