JVP Minister slams welfare dependency as ‘legal begging’

Industry and Entrepreneurship Development Minister Sunil Handunneththi, a senior member of the leftist Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), the dominant party in the National People’s Power (NPP) coalition, has criticised Sri Lanka’s welfare culture, calling the acceptance of Aswesuma benefits “legal begging” and urging citizens to reject long-term dependency on State aid.

Speaking at a public meeting, Handunneththi said poverty eradication must come from sustainable, productive solutions rather than recurring welfare handouts.

“Aswesuma beneficiaries should be ashamed. It is like begging legally. If we want to develop as a nation, we must move away from this dependency mentality,” he said.

The Minister said the Government, led by a left-leaning coalition, does not intend to sustain the Aswesuma program indefinitely or exploit it for political gain.

“The goal should be to end Aswesuma through a clear program and plan. I would be happy to see the day when this subsidy no longer exists,” he said.

Handunneththi added that the transition away from welfare should not be abrupt or coercive. “It is up to the people to decide. Will poverty always exist, or will we challenge it and move forward?” he asked.
