Monk on hunger strike for Mahinda

A Buddhist monk from Rathupaswala, Ven. Theripahala Siridhamma Thero, began a hunger strike in Tangalle yesterday to protest the Governmentâ€™s decision to withdraw the security detail of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.

The protest started around 1 p.m. near the D. S. Senanayake statue, opposite Carlton House in Tangalle, according to local reports.

The monk is demanding the reinstatement of security for Rajapaksa and other former presidents, arguing that removing state protection for a former head of state is unacceptable and poses risks to their safety.

Ven. Siridhamma Thero said he will continue the fast until the government reverses the decision and restores full security arrangements.
