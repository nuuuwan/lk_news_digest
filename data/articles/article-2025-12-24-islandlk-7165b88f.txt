Ogilvy Group Sri Lanka has once again secured its place among the region’s top marketing and communications agencies at this year’s Campaign Asia Agency of the Year Awards, continuing a winning streak that spans the past seven years.

This year’s awards ceremony, held in Mumbai, India, saw Ogilvy Digital and Phoenix Ogilvy bring home two metals: the Silver award in the ‘Rest of South Asia Digital Innovation Agency of the Year’ category and the Bronze in the ‘Creative Agency of the Year’ category.

These latest wins bring the Group’s total metal tally across multiple disciplines at the Agency of the Year Awards to a record 15 since 2018, spanning Digital, Advertising, Media, and PR.

The Campaign Asia Awards, now in their 32nd year, are widely regarded as the benchmark for agency excellence in Asia-Pacific. The judging process goes beyond creativity, placing significant emphasis on the agency’s operational strengths such as talent retention, company culture, innovation, industry contribution, and strategic foresight in addressing future trends.
