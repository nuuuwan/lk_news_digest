Kerner Haus Global Solutions PLC has begun executing its asset-light growth strategy with the signing of a Property Management Agreement with VKM Services Ltd., for a prime commercial property at No. 46/10, Nawam Mawatha, Colombo 2.

The company said the deal is expected to generate Rs. 12.6 million in annual management fees from existing leases.

Kerner Haus said the agreement marks the first phase of its plan to build a property management platform before moving into selective asset acquisitions. The strategy is intended to create recurring fee income while demonstrating operational capability in managing fully serviced office environments.

The Nawam Mawatha property, with capacity for about 300 office seats, is situated in Colombo’s financial district among major banks and corporates. The location offers strong transport connectivity and access to business services, positioning it for BPO, KPO, and international small and medium enterprise (SME) tenants seeking central business district space.

The facility will be operated under the Kerner Haus brand as a fully serviced office centre offering ready-to-use workspaces with utilities, internet, and maintenance and support services. The company said demand for flexible and professionally managed office solutions is rising with the expansion of Sri Lanka’s outsourcing and business services sector.

The company reported a net asset value of a negative Rs. 72 as of end-September 2025. Ekta Global Ltd., was the majority shareholder with a 63.62% stake on a 27.4% public float.

The shares ended yesterday at Rs. 780.50, up from the previous closing of Rs. 656.
