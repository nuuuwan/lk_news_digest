T-Bill yields climb as Central Bank calibrates auction

Yields on government Treasury Bills rose across the board at this week’s auction, indicating a slight shift in investor sentiment. The Central Bank accepted Rs. 82.5 billion out of a much larger total of bids, with the sharpest increase seen for the 12-month bill.

In the secondary market, trading was quiet initially but saw heightened selling pressure later in the week, pushing yields higher, particularly for short to medium-term securities.

The rupee held steady against the US dollar, closing unchanged at Rs. 309.54.

Market analysts said this uptick in yields likely reflects shifting market expectations, potentially anticipating tighter liquidity conditions or future policy adjustments.

“The Central Bank’s decision to accept only a portion of the bids, while allowing yields to rise, suggests a calibrated approach to managing borrowing costs. This movement increases the government’s interest expense on new debt, signalling cautious investor sentiment amid evolving macroeconomic factors,” they noted.
