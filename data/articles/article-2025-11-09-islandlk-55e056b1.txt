Amid economic shifts, Seylan Bank touts resilient credit and robust returns

Seylan Bank PLC has demonstrated strong financial performance in a dynamic economic climate, according to a recent analysis by First Capital Research. The bank’s third-quarter results for 2025 highlight a trajectory of robust growth, anchored by resilient credit expansion and a conservative financial strategy.

The bank reported a near 40% year-on-year surge in net profit, which it attributes to a more than 20% expansion of its loan portfolio. Key drivers for this growth included increased lending in international trade, lease rentals, and pawning facilities. This was complemented by a strong 17% rise in fee-based income from cards, remittances, and other financial services.

The analysis further notes the bank’s strengthened risk position, evidenced by a substantial reduction in impairment charges. Capital ratios also remain comfortably above regulatory requirements, underscoring a prudent approach to balance sheet management.

Based on this performance, analysts project the bank’s net profit will rise to LKR 11.5 billion for the full year 2025, with a further increase to LKR 15.4 billion forecast for 2026. The combination of resilient credit growth, a sharp improvement in asset quality, and strong capital buffers indicate that the bank is navigating the current economic environment with notable momentum.
