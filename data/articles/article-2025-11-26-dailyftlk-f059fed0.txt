Sri Lanka Economic Summit 2025 next week with over 850 participants

The Sri Lanka Economic and Investment Summit 2025, to be held on 2 and 3 December, under the theme ‘Gateway to Growth – Asia’s Emerging Opportunity’ organised by The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, is officially sold out, bringing together more than 850 participants, including over 100 international delegates from across the globe.

The strong global response reflects the Summit’s growing role as a central meeting point for business leaders looking to reconnect with Sri Lanka’s economy. Delegates from Austria, Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, Ethiopia, Germany, India, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Japan, Malaysia, Maldives, Pakistan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States, will participate at the event.

The summit will feature over 40 high-profile speakers from Sri Lanka and overseas, covering a wide span of sectors including trade, investment, manufacturing, renewable energy, technology, logistics, tourism, financial services, and agriculture. The agenda is designed to give businesses unique insights into emerging opportunities, policy developments, and areas where private sector participation can drive growth.

Participants will also have the opportunity to hear directly from senior policymakers and industry specialists, offering a direct channel to understand new reforms and the direction of Sri Lanka’s economic recovery.

In addition to the Summit’s proceedings, participants will also have the opportunity to network with delegates from the abovementioned countries via B2B and government-to-business meeting opportunities, to explore trade, investment, and business growth opportunities. With the event now sold out, the Ceylon Chamber has now begun scheduling B2B meetings among registered participants.
