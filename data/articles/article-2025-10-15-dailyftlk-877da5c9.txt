Govt. allows rice imports amid local Keeri Samba shortage

The Cabinet of Ministers on Monday approved a proposal to permit rice importers to bring in up to 520 metric tons of Ponni Samba rice per importer, without permits, to address the current shortage of Keeri Samba in the local market.

Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa said the decision follows concerns that Keeri Samba is being sold above the Government’s control price due to limited availability.

According to the Department of Census and Statistics’ Household Income and Expenditure Survey, Sri Lanka’s annual rice consumption is estimated at 2.46 million metric tons, of which about 10% or 246,000 metric tons is Keeri Samba.

The imports will be allowed from 15 October to 15 November subject to the maximum limit of 520 metric tons per importer and exemption from the usual permit requirement, Dr. Jayatissa said.
