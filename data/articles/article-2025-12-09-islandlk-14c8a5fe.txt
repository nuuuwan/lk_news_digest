Wealth Trust Securities to raise Rs. 500.8 million via IPO

The recent announcement of Wealth Trust Securities Ltd.’s Rs. 500.8 million Initial Public Offering -IPO- comes at a moment when Sri Lanka’s interest-rate environment is gradually easing, allowing well-capitalised primary dealers to expand their trading portfolios and secure long-term positions in government securities.

Company chairman Senaka Weerasooria told journalists in Colombo that the IPO is not merely a capital-raising exercise, but a reinforcement of the disciplined structure that has defined the company since its inception.

He noted that WTS enters the public market with what is already one of the most robust capital bases in the industry, and with “absolute confidence that investors are joining a journey that has consistently returned value.”

Weerasooria said the capital infusion will further solidify WTS’s ability to absorb volatility, particularly amid cyclical movements in Treasury yields.

Despite maintaining a conservative trading outlook, the company has managed to average a 31% ROE over the past twelve years — a figure management repeatedly highlighted as evidence of resilience across both tightening and loosening rate cycles.

Managing Director and CEO Romesh Gomez said that in recent months the direction of policy rates and market liquidity has begun shifting favourably, creating clear value-accretion opportunities for disciplined portfolio expansion. With additional capital, he noted, WTS has greater room to capture advantageous auction positions, broaden secondary market activity and align its investment scale to emerging market windows.

Gomez acknowledged that FY25 reflected compressed performance due to systemic realignment, with revenue at Rs. 4.6 billion and PAT at Rs. 1.2 billion. However, he pointed out that profit sustainability, even through a difficult cycle, speaks to strong operational controls. The A- rating with a Positive outlook continues to stand, reinforcing the company’s position as a stable counterparty in a specialised sector.

Asia Securities Advisors, managing the IPO, pointed out that the offer price of Rs. 7 presents meaningful upside when benchmarked against underlying valuation metrics. The move into the listed environment, they noted, enhances governance visibility — a point increasingly valued among institutional investors participating in the Government securities market.
