Beauty benefits … with eggs

Mix together one teaspoon of egg white and a big squeeze of lemon juice, and apply it to your whole face, or just where you have large pores. Wait 15 minutes and then rinse with warm water, and pat dry!

Apply a thin layer of pure egg whites to the skin. Concentrate on any areas where you see sagging – cheeks, jaw line, etc.). Allow to dry (usually 20 minutes), and then rinse off with cool water. You can do this under your eye bags, as well, but be careful not to get it in your eye!

Take one egg yolk and mix together with 01 tablespoon coconut oil, or honey, and apply it to your skin. Leave on for 5-10 minutes and then rinse with warm water and apply your favourite moisturiser.

Whisk the egg white until it becomes frothy. Add about 02 teaspoons of orange juice and ½ a teaspoon of turmeric powder and mix all the ingredients thoroughly and apply this mixture all over your face and neck area. Allow this face mask to rest on your face until it dries out completely before rinsing it off with cold water. Follow this face mask with a gentle moisturiser.

Mix together 02-03 large egg whites and 01 tablespoon lemon juice and apply the entire mixture to your scalp (before showering), and leave it for 05-10 minutes, and then wash your hair with warm water as usual! This is so good for excess oil. Applying egg whites to the scalp can also stimulate hair growth.

Mix together a whole egg with an egg yolk and a tablespoon of coconut oil and apply the whole mixture to the middle part of the hair, down through the ends (basically everywhere below the ears). Leave it on for 05-10 minutes, and then wash your hair as you normally would.
