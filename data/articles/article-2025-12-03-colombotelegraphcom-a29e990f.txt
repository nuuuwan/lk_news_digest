Rising From The Ruins Of Cyclone Ditwah: A Nation’s Gratitude To Its True Friends

Cyclone Ditwah has left behind a trail of unprecedented devastation—entire communities swept away, thousands displaced, and many lives tragically lost, some forever unidentified. As the nation mourns one of the most painful chapters in our recent history, we also witness the extraordinary strength of our people. Amidst grief and desolation, one truth stands out: the world reached out to Sri Lanka with compassion, courage, and genuine solidarity.

Even as the scale of destruction unfolded, messages of sympathy and offers of assistance poured in from every corner of the globe. Emergency teams, naval assets, medical units, and humanitarian relief arrived with remarkable speed.

These acts represent more than diplomatic gestures — they reflect a shared humanity that prevails above all boundaries.

Among the many nations that supported us, India’s response through the Sagar Bandhu Humanitarian Operation remains unmatched in its scale, swiftness, and heartfelt sincerity.

• Relief supplies, medical teams, and engineering corps were deployed with precision and deep concern.

In an extraordinary demonstration of goodwill and humanitarian leadership, the Government of India even opened its airspace for Pakistan—a nation with whom it has had a historically strained relationship—so that Pakistani aircraft carrying aid could reach Sri Lanka without delay.

It reflects a profound commitment to humanitarian values at a time when every minute mattered to save lives.

Such actions are remembered not only by governments but by entire generations.

Our connection with India runs deeper than modern borders or political agreements. It reaches back into the prehistoric and civilizational heritage of this island.

From the time of Lord Buddha, whose message later came to Lanka through Arahat Mahinda and Sanghamitta, carrying the blessings of Dhamma and the sacred Bodhi sapling, India has been inseparably interwoven with our spiritual and cultural evolution.

The compassion we see today echoes that ancient lineage of friendship.

This catastrophe has reminded us that when human lives are in peril, political differences become irrelevant.

India’s leadership during Cyclone Ditwa has set a new benchmark for regional humanitarian support.

We also deeply appreciate the assistance from other friendly nations across Asia, the Middle East, Europe, Australia, and beyond. Each contribution has helped us stand again.

Yet the scale and immediacy of India’s support reflect a bond built on trust, proximity, and shared destiny.

For the victims, international support is not merely material relief — it is emotional reassurance.

It tells them they are seen, valued, and not abandoned in their darkest hour.

For the nation, global solidarity is a reminder that even in tragedy, we are part of a compassionate international community.

As we rebuild lives, livelihoods, and infrastructure, we must also rebuild our systems — our preparedness, early warnings, environmental resilience, and disaster management capacities.

The world stood by us; now we must strengthen ourselves for the future.

On behalf of all Sri Lankans, we express profound gratitude to every nation and organization that came forward.

And to India — through the Sagar Bandhu mission and its remarkable humanitarian gestures — we offer a special note of heartfelt appreciation for standing with us as a true friend, trusted neighbor, and compassionate partner, as it has done throughout history.

Sri Lanka will rise again — stronger, wiser, and forever grateful to those who helped us stand.
