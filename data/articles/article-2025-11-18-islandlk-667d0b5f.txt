‘Recognizing science, research and innovation vital for economic turnaround’

Sri Lanka’s economic turnaround will not be achieved through tighter budgets or debt restructuring alone—it will depend on whether the country can finally recognise science, research and innovation as serious engines of growth. That was the clear, uncompromising message from internationally respected scientist Professor Neelika Malavige, speaking at the recent IDEAnet Health Forum of the University of Colombo.

Malavige argued that Sri Lanka is missing its biggest economic opportunity by failing to treat innovation as a business asset. Nations such as Singapore and South Korea, she said, became global success stories not through natural resources, but by building systems that reward efficiency, research, and knowledge creation. “Their prosperity came from ideas,” she stressed. “We have the talent, but we continue to smother it under red tape.”

She pointed out that Sri Lanka and Singapore started the 1960s on near-equal footing. Today, Singapore’s GDP per capita is more than ten times higher. That gap, she warned, reflects decades of lost innovation capacity. Sri Lanka’s position at 93rd on the Global Innovation Index tells the same story—a country with potential but without the systems to convert ideas into economic output. For the private sector, she said, the realisation must hit hard: innovation is not a luxury. It is the most underdeveloped industry in Sri Lanka, and possibly the most profitable one if unlocked.

The biggest barrier, Malavige insisted, is not money but bureaucracy. She gave a striking example: research materials are taxed at 33 percent, then subjected to another 33 percent through intermediaries, before taking up to eight months to reach a laboratory. By then, only a fraction of the allocated funds actually turns into research. “In Oxford,” she said, “I received the same reagent in two days.” Such delays and inefficiencies, she emphasised, are not just academic frustrations—they translate into lost competitiveness, delayed product development, weaker investor confidence, and millions in missed opportunities.

Malavige believes Sri Lanka urgently needs to build a bridge between universities and industry if it wants to create new commercial sectors. She pointed to India’s transformation of its vaccine industry and to countries like the Netherlands and Senegal, which now export agricultural technologies and WHO-approved vaccines despite their modest size. Sri Lanka, she said, can produce diagnostics, medical technologies, and agritech solutions for regional markets—but only if the system stops obstructing those who try.

The ongoing brain drain, Malavige added, is not simply a social tragedy; it is an economic leak. Every researcher who leaves represents years of investment disappearing, along with the innovations and industry collaborations they would have generated.

Scientists, she said, are leaving because they cannot operate efficiently in a system crippled by delays, rigid procedures, and the absence of meaningful incentives. High-impact research, whether published internationally or locally, receives the same treatment. “That kills ambition, she said. “And ambition is the raw material of innovation.”

Health research, she noted, is not just about saving lives; it is an economic shield. During COVID-19, Sri Lanka used an antibody test developed with minimal resources, saving millions in testing costs. Such examples prove that homegrown innovation yields measurable financial returns. But she cautioned that if a future pandemic—what global experts refer to as “pathogen X”—hits Sri Lanka with systems this inefficient, the economic consequences would be devastating.
