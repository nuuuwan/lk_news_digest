RIUNIT to promote Sri Lanka’s  real estate at London  Investment Forum 2025

The Research Intelligence Unit (RIUNIT) together with the High Commission of Sri Lanka in London will hold the Sri Lanka Real Estate Investment Forum: London 2025 on Thursday, 30 October at the Sri Lanka High Commission, 13 Hyde Park Gardens, Tyburnia, London W2 2LU.

The event will take place from 4:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. (BST), followed by networking and fellowship until 8:30 p.m.

RIUNIT has been organising international real estate forums for many years in cities around the world. The upcoming London event will be the first major overseas forum since 2023. It comes at an important time as Sri Lanka’s real estate market shows signs of new growth and stronger investor confidence.

The forum will bring together international investors, developers, government officials, and members of the Sri Lankan diaspora community living in the UK. Presentations and discussions will highlight the latest market trends, new projects, and investment opportunities in the country’s property sector.

RIUNIT CEO Roshan Madawela said: “The level of interest witnessed already demonstrates a surge in interest amongst the diaspora community to invest in Sri Lanka, given a favourable economic and political climate.”

The main sponsor of the event is Home Lands Skyline. The event is also supported by Port City Colombo, Cinnamon Air, and Athi Rasa, showing the wide range of industries that now connect to real estate and investment growth in Sri Lanka.
