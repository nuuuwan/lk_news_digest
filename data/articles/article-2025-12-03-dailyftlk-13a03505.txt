TMC sets stage for transformative growth with Northern Investment Summit

To build groundwork for transformative initiative, TMC delegation visits Northern Province engaging in high-impact meetings and fostering strong public–private collaboration

The Management Club (TMC) has announced the Northern Investment Summit (NIS), a landmark initiative in January 2026 aimed at unlocking the full potential of the Northern Province and positioning it as one of the country’s most promising investment frontiers.

The Summit’s core purpose is to generate widespread awareness of the region’s immense potential, attract both local and foreign investors and create a unified platform for dialogue between Government Authorities, State Agencies, Investors and local stakeholders.

By spotlighting key development sectors such as Agriculture and Fisheries, Education, IT and Technology, Tourism, Retail and Energy, NIS aims to catalyse sustainable growth while enabling the infrastructure, logistics support and SME empowerment necessary to drive long-term transformation. Equally important is the emphasis on aligning manpower capacity with future industry requirements through targeted skill development and capacity building—ensuring the people of the North are fully prepared to participate in the region’s emerging opportunities.

A central strength of the NIS initiative is its alignment with the Government of Sri Lanka’s national development vision.

The Summit has drawn remarkable multi-agency endorsement and involvement, reinforcing its strategic importance. The Board of Investment (BOI) has pledged support by providing comprehensive investment information for the Northern region—including zonal opportunities—and by sharing NIS material with foreign missions. The Export Development Board (EDB) is exploring support for promotional activities; speaker travel and post-event outcomes while also circulating NIS details internationally. The National Enterprise Development Authority (NEDA) is contributing through information sharing, planning guidance and the integration of incubation centres, and the Small Enterprises Development Division (SEDD) is set to provide presence and stall support at the Summit.

Further alignment has come from the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Fisheries, the Coconut Development Authority, the Urban Development Authority (UDA), the Industrial Development Board (IDB) and the Foreign Affairs Ministry —each reinforcing national-level commitment to making NIS a cornerstone of regional economic renewal.

To build the groundwork for this transformative initiative, a dedicated TMC delegation visited the Northern Province from 16 to 19 November 2025, engaging in high-impact meetings and fostering strong public–private collaboration.

The delegation led by TMC NIS Project Chairman Indhra Kaushal Rajapaksa; comprised, Deputy Chair of the Project Shanthi Barghradan, TMC Board of Management Vice President – Finance Chandima Hulangamuwa, Past Presidents Jude Joseph and Deepal Abeysekara; and TMC Jaffna Chapter Chairman Anu Rakavan and Secretary Sukirtharuban. Throughout the visit, they were joined by, National Enterprise Development Authority Chairman Lakshman Abeysekera who accompanied the delegation for all meetings, further strengthening national-level participation. Adding significant weight to the discussions, Deputy Minister of Industries Chathuranga Abeysinghe joined online for meetings, demonstrating strong ministerial support for the initiative.

The team engaged in constructive discussions with Business Chambers of Jaffna, as well as with the Government Agents of Jaffna, Mullaitheevu, Kilinochchi, Mannar and Vavuniya. These meetings focused on identifying development bottlenecks, understanding local strengths, exploring investment readiness and establishing long-term collaborative frameworks essential for successful implementation of the Northern Investment Summit. The reception was overwhelmingly positive, with each stakeholder expressing enthusiasm and confidence in the project’s long-lasting value to the region.

The outcomes of the visit were exceptional, forging a series of high-level partnerships and endorsements that will form the backbone of the Summit’s success. A shared vision emerged—one that integrates public sector leadership, private sector drive, and local community engagement to redefine the Northern Province’s economic trajectory.

The Northern Investment Summit stands as a testament to TMC’s enduring commitment to national development. Through this initiative, the organisation continues its legacy of empowering industries, developing leaders, inspiring innovation and championing inclusive growth across the country. It represents one of TMC’s most ambitious national-level contributions—designed to build a more connected, competitive and prosperous Sri Lanka.

As preparations for the Northern Investment Summit gather momentum, the outcomes of the November visit have already ignited a wave of anticipation and renewed interest among investors, industry leaders and policymakers.
