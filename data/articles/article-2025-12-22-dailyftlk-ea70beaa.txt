SL to ratify ILO Convention on workplace violence and harassment

The Cabinet of Ministers has approved steps to introduce legal provisions for the ratification and implementation of the International Labour Organisation’s (ILO) Convention on Eradicating Violence and Harassment in the World of Work (C190), marking a significant step toward strengthening workplace protections across Sri Lanka.

The C190, adopted at the 108th session of the International Labour Conference in 2019, is the first-ever international convention addressing violence and harassment in all forms of work.

The Cabinet’s decision follows the presentation of the convention to Parliament on 4 May 2021, in line with a previous Cabinet resolution from 24 March 2021, and now moves the country closer to formal ratification and execution.

“The convention aims to eliminate violence and harassment in both formal and informal employment settings, creating safer, more secure workplaces for all employees,” Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa said at the weekly post-Cabinet meeting media briefing.

He noted that its implementation is expected to improve workplace conditions, encourage positive engagement in the workforce and particularly support increased participation of women in employment by ensuring safer and more equitable work environments.
