Port City Colombo joins Western Province’s ‘Lights of Hope’ amid national recovery

Port City Colombo marked the start of the festive season with its annual Christmas Tree Lighting Ceremony, held under the theme “Lights of Hope,” in alignment with the Western Province’s initiative. As Sri Lanka continues to recover from the impact of Cyclone Ditwah, the ceremony was more than a seasonal observance; it offered a moment of reflection and unity, bringing together leaders and stakeholders in support of national recovery efforts.

The event was attended by senior government officials, dignitaries, partners, and stakeholders, with Hon. Hanif Yusoof, Governor of the Western Province, gracing the occasion as Chief Guest. In his address, the Governor underscored the importance of collective responsibility and standing together as communities rebuild. He also noted with appreciation CHEC Port City Colombo (Pvt) Ltd.’s Rs. 10 million contribution to the Government’s ‘Rebuilding Sri Lanka’ Fund and the deployment of heavy machinery and technical support along the A5 route from Kandy to Nuwara Eliya, assisting disaster-response and infrastructure restoration efforts.

Speaking at the event, Harsha Amarasekera (PC), Chairman of the Colombo Port City Economic Commission, highlighted that the ceremony went beyond a festive tradition. He said aligning with the Western Province’s “Lights of Hope” initiative reflects Port City Colombo’s commitment to responsible engagement and solidarity during challenging times. He also praised the strong partnership between the Commission, the Government, and CHEC Port City Colombo (Pvt) Ltd., noting the company’s swift response to support disaster relief and infrastructure recovery.

A poignant highlight of the ceremony was a one-minute silence, observed in remembrance, prayer, and solidarity with those affected by Cyclone Ditwah. The moment served as a reminder of shared loss, strength, and collective hope for recovery.
