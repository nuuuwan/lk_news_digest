Supported over 8 million subscribers across Mobile, Home Broadband, and Dialog Television through free voice, SMS, data, and access to 39 local and international channels.

Sincerely regrets the inconvenience endured by customers due to network disruptions and commits to a more resilient network.

Dialog to invest USD 250 million over the next three years to expand coverage with approximately 800 new sites in underserved regions and enhance climate-resilient infrastructure.

Sri Lanka recently faced one of its most challenging periods in recent years, as floods and landslides disrupted families, communities, and essential infrastructure across the country. In response, Dialog Axiata PLC mobilised an extensive, countrywide effort to support national emergency operations, maintain critical communication channels, and restore connectivity for millions of Sri Lankans.

Reflecting on the technical impact and the work carried out across the network, Ranga Kariyawasam, Group Chief Technology Officer of Dialog Axiata PLC, stated, “The recent severe weather caused extensive damage across several layers of our network. Fibre backbone cuts, site flooding, prolonged power outages, and restricted access to affected areas resulted in the loss of connectivity at 2,200 of our 6,000 sites. These conditions were unprecedented in scale and complexity. Our teams responded immediately, working around the clock, often in challenging conditions, to restore services as quickly as possible. I am pleased to share that our full network is now operational, marking one of the fastest recovery efforts we have carried out in recent years. This achievement was made possible by the dedication of our engineering, field, and support teams, and through the invaluable cooperation of the TRCSL, Tri Forces, Police, Disaster Management Centre, and local authorities. We extend our sincere appreciation to all who assisted us during this period.”

Dialog supported over 8 million customers across its services during this period. This included 6 million Mobile customers who benefited from over 4.5 million GB of free data quota, 1.4 billion of free voice minutes and 1.4 billion of free SMS; almost 1 million Home Broadband customers who received over 10 million GB of emergency data quota; and 1.6 million Dialog Television customers who received complimentary access to 39 channels. These measures helped families stay connected to loved ones and access critical information at a time when communication was essential.

The company also strengthened national emergency response efforts by activating early warning systems and disseminating over 40 million alerts, while providing satellite connectivity and Wi-Fi to the Sri Lanka Air Force, Sri Lanka Army, and the Disaster Management Centre to ensure uninterrupted coordination among response teams. Beyond connectivity, the company supported humanitarian relief reaching over 400,000 families through partner organisations and extended assistance to employees, retailers, and distributors affected by the disaster.

Looking ahead, as the country’s largest Foreign Direct Investor (FDI), Dialog aims to invest a further USD 250 million over the next three years to expand coverage through addition of 800 sites, enhance climate-resilient infrastructure, strengthen redundancy and backup power systems, and broaden alternative connectivity solutions; reinforcing the company’s commitment towards supporting Sri Lanka’s recovery and long-term digital development.

Speaking about Dialog’s continued commitment to the country, Supun Weerasinghe, Group Chief Executive of Dialog Axiata PLC, said, “The past weeks have tested the strength of our nation, and we recognise the impact this had on many of our customers. For the disruptions they experienced, we sincerely apologise and reaffirm our commitment to building a more resilient network. I extend my sincere appreciation to our teams across every part of the organisation. Their unwavering commitment, professionalism, and personal sacrifices during this period were instrumental in restoring services swiftly and safely. Our priority now is to ensure that every Sri Lankan, in every community, has access to dependable connectivity. We are committed to expanding our reach and strengthening the resilience of our network, so that the country is better supported today and better prepared for the future.”

With services now fully operational nationwide, Dialog reiterates its commitment to standing with the people of Sri Lanka and playing a meaningful role in rebuilding a stronger, more resilient, and digitally empowered nation.
