Morari Bapu’s Ram Katha enchants devotees in Sri Lanka

Negombo, Sri Lanka: The sacred message of Maryada Purushottam Shri Ram resonated across Sri Lanka as Pujya Morari Bapu, the revered Ramkatha exponent and spiritual guide, narrated the Ram Katha in Negombo, marking the Sri Lankan chapter of the historic Ram Yatra.

Following the spiritually enriching Katha in Rameshwaram, where Lord Ram is believed to have worshipped Lord Shiva before crossing the ocean, Bapu and his devotees journeyed across the waters to Sri Lanka, retracing the divine footsteps of Lord Ram.

The open-air Katha in Negombo saw a gathering of over 400 devotees from Sri Lanka and around the world, joining together in prayer, music, and reflection. In a symbolic gesture, followers, lovingly called Bapu’s flowers, travelled by chartered flights from India to Sri Lanka, representing a modern-day re-enactment of Ram’s crossing to Sri Lanka, a journey from devotion to liberation, from dharma to victory.

This Sri Lanka Katha forms a significant milestone in Bapu’s ongoing Ram Yatra, a monumental 8,000-kilometre pilgrimage tracing the sacred path of Lord Ram’s exile, journey to Lanka, and return to Ayodhya. The Yatra, which began in Chitrakoot, will culminate with the final Ram Katha in Ayodhya. Speaking at the Katha, Spiritual leader Morari Bapu said, “A person should stay with themselves, or with a sadhu (guru) or the memory of their guru. Sadhu’s eyes cannot be deceived; they are filled with faith, not corruption. A person who has the discretion of utilising the momentum, grasps perpetuity.”
