Assetline Finance soars high, nearing 40% asset growth during 1st half of FY2025/26

Assetline Finance Limited, which forms the core financial services pillar within the David Pieris Group, reported a strengthened and increasingly resilient first-half performance for FY2025/26, with significant gains in asset growth, income enhancement, and core profitability for the six months ended 30 September 2025. Total assets expanded to Rs. 72,712 million, representing nearly 40% growth within the first half of the financial year; an achievement that underscores the Company’s accelerated balance sheet expansion and deepening market presence. This broader and more robust balance sheet was driven by sustained lending growth and continued improvements in asset quality.

Income generation also remained strong, with interest income rising to Rs. 6,732 million and net interest income increasing to Rs. 4,826 million, supported by healthy traction in lending and leasing operations, disciplined pricing strategies, and more efficient capital allocation. Profit before tax reached Rs. 2,940 million, while profit after tax stood at Rs. 1,416 million, underpinned by efficient collections and remedial measures, strengthened underwriting controls, and improved operating efficiency. In line with its commitment to national development, the Company contributed nearly 52% of its profit before tax toward government taxes during the period, reflecting a substantial and responsible fiscal contribution.

The lending portfolio expanded to Rs. 60,631 million, reflecting heightened credit demand across SME, micro-enterprise, and mobility-based customer segments. This represents a remarkable 42% growth during the first half of the financial year, demonstrating strong market traction and effective credit deployment. Equity also strengthened to Rs. 17,154 million, supported by retained earnings, resulting in a solid capital adequacy position that provides further capacity for accelerated growth.

Asset quality metrics demonstrated clear improvement. The Gross Stage 3 Loan Ratio improved to 4.0% from 9.7% a year earlier, while the Net Stage 3 Ratio improved to 1.8% from 6.4%, reflecting a more stable and better-performing portfolio. Notably, the Stage 3 Impairment Coverage Ratio increased sharply to 55.0%, up from 37.9% in the previous year’s corresponding period, indicating stronger provisioning discipline and enhanced risk management practices. Liquidity indicators also remained healthy, supported by a balanced borrowing structure and prudent treasury management.
