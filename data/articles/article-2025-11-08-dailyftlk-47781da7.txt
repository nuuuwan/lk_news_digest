INFOTEL 2025 opens at BMICH

The three-day INFOTEL 2025, organised by the Federation of Information Technology Industry Sri Lanka (FITIS) opened yesterday at the BMICH.

This year’s theme, “Fuelling the Digital Economy,” captures the essence of the moment. It is both a rallying call and a roadmap, urging every sector of the economy to embrace digitalization as the engine of national progress.

Over the years, INFOTEL has evolved from a technology exhibition into a strategic platform for policy dialogue, industry innovation, and knowledge exchange. The 2025 edition aims to highlight how emerging technologies — from artificial intelligence and automation to fintech, gaming, cybersecurity, and digital education — can unlock new opportunities across industries.

FITIS Chairman Dr. Dayan Rajapakse said: “INFOTEL has always been more than an exhibition. It is a national mission — one that brings together the brightest minds and strongest institutions to build Sri Lanka’s digital economy. The $ 15 billion target is ambitious, but through collaboration and innovation, it is within our reach.”

The event serves as a bridge between Government policy and private sector innovation, creating a unified space for investors, educators, and entrepreneurs to collaborate on shaping the country’s digital roadmap.

INFOTEL Committee Chairman Thariq Sanoon said: “INFOTEL 2025 represents a shared national vision. It is where technology leaders, startups, and young innovators come together to turn ideas into reality. We want every Sri Lankan — from students to CEOs — to see their role in fuelling the digital economy.”

Deputy Minister of Digital Economy Deputy Minister Eng. Eranga Weeraratne said: “To reach $ 15 billion in ICT exports, Sri Lanka must build an ecosystem that supports innovation, entrepreneurship, and talent. INFOTEL provides that platform — where the private sector, Government, and academia meet to shape the country’s digital future.”
