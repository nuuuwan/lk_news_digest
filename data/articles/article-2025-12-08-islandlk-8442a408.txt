Fun time for Melantha Down Under

Melantha Perera’s opener in Australia, on his current solo tour, was in Sydney.

He was seen in action at ‘Moratuwa Night -Two’ where he was backed by the group Redemption.

It was a sing-along event which, later in the evening, had the crowd dancing, as well.

“A heartfelt thank you to everyone who graced ‘Moratuwa Night –Two’ and what fun we all had!

“Leaving my home, in Sydney, makes me a little sad, but I’m grateful for all the memorable moments we shared.”

“I’m back in Melbourne, looking forward to a bright and beautiful Christmas. Let’s get together at my first Christmas 2025 … in Melbourne.”
