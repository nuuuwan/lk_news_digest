Prime Group stands with children of Police families affected by Cyclone Ditwah

In the aftermath of Cyclone Ditwah, while Sri Lanka Police officers worked tirelessly to safeguard lives and property across the country, many of their own families endured significant hardship. Recognising this silent struggle, Prime Group launched a national-level initiative to support the children of affected police families, providing essential educational supplies and ensuring that their education could continue uninterrupted despite the challenges they faced.

Prime Group supplied essential school materials to children affected by Cyclone Ditwah, helping them resume their studies with confidence and dignity. Through this initiative, undertaken as a responsible corporate citizen, 1000 students across Sri Lanka received support, with an investment of Rs. 10 million.

The donations were handed over at a ceremonial event held at Sri Lanka Police Headquarters, attended by the Public Security and Parliamentary Affairs Minister, Public Security Ministry senior officials, the Inspector General of Police, Senior DIGs, and representatives of the Police Family Welfare Association and the Police Seva Vanitha Unit, along with police officers. Prime Group was represented by its Chairman, Co-Chairperson, CEO, and senior management. The initiative was carried out under the coordination of Aruna Prasad Lekamge and Prof. Krishantha Pathiraja.

Prime Group Co-Chairperson Sandamini Perera said, “Prime Group is honoured to stand with police families and support their children, as a gesture of gratitude for the selfless service rendered to our country. Despite facing personal loss and hardship, the officers of the Sri Lanka Police continued to serve the nation with unwavering dedication during Cyclone Ditwah. Their commitment to safeguarding communities under the most challenging circumstances deserves our deepest respect.”

As Prime Group celebrates 30 years of leadership in Sri Lanka’s real estate sector, the Group continues to reinforce its commitment to building resilient communities and supporting the nation beyond business. This program underscores Prime Group’s long-standing belief in creating lasting value for families and standing with those who serve the country in times of need.
