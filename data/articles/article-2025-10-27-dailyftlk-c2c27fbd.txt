Bureau of Foreign Employment to nab driver for defrauding Rs. 10 m with job promises in Israel

The Special Investigation Unit (SIU) of the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE) has arrested a female who has close connections with a SLBFE driver, who has defaulted over Rs. 10 million from job seekers promising jobs in Israel.

According to the SLBFE, the SIU had received several complaints regarding a large-scale scam carried out by the driver, who had been working at the SLBFE and had been dismissed, claiming to provide jobs in Israel.

Acting on the instructions of SLBFE Chairman Kosala Wickramasinghe, the Bureau’s Police Unit launched a special probe into the matter.

Investigations revealed that the suspect had collected large sums of money from individuals across the country, claiming he could secure them jobs in Israel. The money was deposited into a bank account belonging to a woman identified as his mistress.

The SIU officers of the Bureau arrested the woman on Saturday in the Avissawella area. During questioning, she admitted to maintaining a close relationship with the driver and allowing her account to be used for the transactions.

She was produced before the Avissawella Acting Magistrate and remanded until today (27).

The Bureau confirmed that eight formal complaints have been lodged so far against the absconding driver, with total defrauded amounts estimated to be around Rs. 10 million.

SLBFE Chairman Wickramasinghe said extensive efforts were underway to track down and arrest the main suspect.

“We are committed to bringing all those involved in foreign employment frauds to justice, irrespective of their position,” he said. “The Bureau’s newly established Police Unit has already exposed several such scams, and we will ensure strict legal action against the culprits.”

The Bureau has urged any additional victims of this scam to come forward and lodge complaints via its hotline 1989.
