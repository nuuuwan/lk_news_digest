Complaint against MP Shritharan handed over to Speaker

Serious concerns have been raised over the conduct of Member of Parliament and member of the Constitutional Council S. Shritharan, following formal complaints submitted to the Speaker of Parliament regarding gross breaches of privilege and violations of the Code of Conduct expected of elected representatives.

It was alleged that while sitting in one of the country’s most powerful oversight bodies, Shritharan has failed to disclose bribery allegations pending against him, a grave omission that raises questions about his integrity and fitness to serve on the Constitutional Council — a body mandated to ensure transparency, independence, and ethical governance.

Recent revelations indicate that Shritharan has consistently voted with the Government, in apparent quid pro quo arrangements aimed at shielding himself from accountability. It was alleged that his alignment with Government interests, despite being nominated by minority Opposition parties, undermines the collective trust placed in him and betrays the will of those he was appointed to represent.

According to the submissions before the Speaker, Shritharan’s conduct constitutes multiple and serious violations – he has acted contrary to Article 41A(1)(e) of the Constitution by disregarding the consensus of opposition parties; breached Article 29 of the Parliament (Powers and Privileges) Act by obstructing Parliament’s representative function; and violated Articles 7, 9, and 25 of the Code of Conduct for Members of Parliament by failing to act in the public interest, by engaging in actions that create conflicts of interest, and by possibly accepting inducements that compromise impartiality.

It was alleged that by concealing bribery allegations and voting with the Government while under scrutiny, Shritharan has transformed his constitutional responsibility into personal protection, turning an institution of accountability into a shield for his own misconduct.

By casting votes contrary to the consensus of Opposition members who nominated him, it was alleged he has wilfully violated the Constitution, betrayed minority Opposition representation, and eroded the ethical foundation of the Constitutional Council. His silence on the serious corruption allegations against him violates the principles of transparency, accountability, and integrity that Parliament must uphold.
