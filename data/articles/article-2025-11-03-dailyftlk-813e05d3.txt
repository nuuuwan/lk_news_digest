Empowering women-led exporters with trade data insights

The Sri Lanka Export Development Board (EDB), under its Women Entrepreneurship Development Program in collaboration with Verité Research, successfully conducted the training program on Leveraging Trade Data for Export Success on 21 October at the EDB Training Arena, Colombo.

The program brought together 35 women-led exporters from diverse sectors, providing them with the opportunity to enhance their knowledge of global trade dynamics, analyse market trends, and make strategic, data-driven decisions to grow their export businesses. Participants engaged in interactive sessions, discussions, and practical exercises designed to strengthen their understanding of export-import data, market access, and competitive landscapes.

The training was led by members of the International Economics Programme from Verité Research, a leading independent policy research organisation in Sri Lanka known for its expertise in economic, trade, and social policy analysis. Lead Economist Mathisha Arangala guided participants through detailed trade data analysis and practical strategies to identify export opportunities and assess global market trends. The team also included Research Director Subhashini Abeysinghe, Program Lead, Economics Malinda Meegoda, and Research Analyst Bulani Weerawadane.

This initiative reflects EDB’s continued commitment to empowering women entrepreneurs, providing them with the tools, knowledge, and confidence to expand into international markets, strengthen their businesses, and contribute to Sri Lanka’s global trade success.

The program also highlights the power of collaboration between research institutions and industry stakeholders to provide meaningful capacity-building opportunities for women-led entrepreneurs.
