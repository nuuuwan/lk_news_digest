Rs. 1.45 b project to upgrade Kolonnawa fuel filling facilities

Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa yesterday said the Cabinet has approved a proposal by the Power and Energy Minister to begin procurement for a Rs. 1.45 billion project to modernise fuel filling facilities at Zone 7 of the Kolonnawa Terminal operated by Ceylon Petroleum Storage Terminals Ltd., (CPSTL).

The project, approved by the CPSTL Board of Directors and endorsed by the Department of National Planning, will be implemented in three stages under an engineering, procurement, and construction contract.

The first phase will cover the construction of new filling facilities for petrol at the Zone 7 site, forming part of a broader plan to introduce state-of-the-art systems for petrol, diesel, and kerosene handling.

The Government said the project is intended to enhance fuel distribution efficiency, safety, and capacity at one of Sri Lankaâ€™s key petroleum storage terminals.
