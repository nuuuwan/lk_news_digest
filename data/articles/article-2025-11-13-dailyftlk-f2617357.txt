A high-profile Sri Lankan business delegation, organised by The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce and its Sri Lanka – Greater Mekong Business Council (SLGMBC), will embark on a trade and investment mission to Cambodia from 14th to 18th November 2025.

The delegation will explore investment opportunities in agriculture, logistics, manufacturing, renewable energy, tourism, and technology.

During the visit, the delegation will participate in the Cambodia Annual Fair & Exhibition (CAFE 2025) and the Agricultural Investment Forum, and engage in targeted B2B meetings with Cambodian counterparts, investors, and trade associations. Key engagements include discussions with Secretary of State Prak David, Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF), as well as the Cambodia Microfinance Association, the Cambodia Investment Board of the Council for the Development of Cambodia (CDC), the Ministry of Industry, Science, Technology & Innovation (MISTI), the Cambodia Chamber of Commerce, the Ministry of Commerce (MOC), and the Cambodia Business Association (CBA).

The mission also includes networking sessions, a welcome reception hosted by the Cambodian Honorary Consulate in Sri Lanka, and cultural experiences in Phnom Penh, including visits to the Royal Palace, Silver Pagoda, Central Market, and a dinner cruise along the Mekong River.

The delegation is visiting Cambodia under the guidance of Kingdom of Cambodia Honorary Consul in Sri Lanka Ruwan Waidyarathna and SLGMBC President Nimal Ratnayake.

Ratnayake said: "This visit is an important step in deepening Sri Lanka’s engagement with Cambodia and the Mekong region. There is real potential for collaboration across multiple sectors, and we hope to forge partnerships that bring long-term value to both nations."

Waidyarathna added: "The growing relationship between our countries reflects shared economic interests and cultural affinity. This delegation will help unlock new opportunities and strengthen trade and investment ties between Sri Lanka and Cambodia."

The mission reflects the Ceylon Chamber’s ongoing commitment to expanding Sri Lanka’s regional trade footprint and supporting local businesses in exploring new opportunities within the ASEAN region.
