SL’s carbon market emerging as a ‘flagship investment frontier’

Sri Lanka is positioning its emerging carbon market as a flagship investment frontier capable of attracting hundreds of millions of dollars in new financing, senior officials said yesterday, unveiling a series of reforms aimed at aligning environmental governance with economic recovery.

Environment Minister Dr. Dhammika Patabendi said global demand for high-quality carbon credits is rising sharply, creating an opportunity for Sri Lanka to monetise its natural assets responsibly.

He added: “Carbon markets are a billion-dollar space and Sri Lanka cannot afford to stay on the sidelines. With credible monitoring and scientific baselines, we can turn forests, wetlands and renewable energy projects into sustainable financial assets.”

The Environment Ministry expects Sri Lanka’s carbon market to generate USD 250–300 million annually within a decade. Officials said more than USD 500 million in climate-finance investment could flow into reforestation, mangroves, renewable energy and industrial decarbonisation projects over the first five years.

Senior Adviser to the Ministry, Dr. Ravindra Kariyawasam, said the ministry’s focus is on credibility and transparency.

“We are building a science-driven, internationally aligned carbon-market architecture. Investors will see clear baselines, clear reporting standards and a system free from manipulation. That is the only way a market like this can work, Dr. Kariyawasam told The Island Financial Review.

He added that Sri Lanka is finalising a national registry, verification guidelines and project methodologies to meet global standards.

“Our aim is simple: every credit issued by Sri Lanka must be trusted and traceable. Once that trust is established, investment naturally follows, he said.

Sri Lanka’s mangrove ecosystems — among the densest in South Asia — are expected to generate over a million carbon credits annually, while renewed forest-management and restoration programmes are being mapped for long-term credit issuance.

Patabendi said nature-based solutions offer both ecological and economic returns.

“If we restore degraded landscapes, we reduce disaster impacts, protect communities and open a new revenue stream. This is environmental protection with economic purpose, he noted.

“Our minerals cannot be exported as raw material indefinitely. We want a sector that is efficient, transparent and capable of generating higher value for the country while maintaining rigorous environmental standards, Patabendi said.
