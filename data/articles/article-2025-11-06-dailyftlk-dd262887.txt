President halts new Mannar wind projects pending public consent

President Anura Kumara Disanayake has directed authorities not to proceed with new wind power projects on Mannar Island without securing the consent of local residents, following public concerns over environmental and social impacts.

According to the renewable energy resource project plan for Mannar Island, identified as a high wind power potential zone, three major wind power projects have been planned.

The Thambapavani Wind Power Plant, one of these projects, commenced operations in 2021. The other two, the 20 MW Windscape Mannar Ltd., project and the 50 MW Hayleys Fentons project, are scheduled to begin operations in December 2025 and December 2026, respectively.

“However, in light of growing public concerns about environmental and social implications, President Disanayake has instructed that no further implementation should take place without the consent of the residents of Mannar Island,” Cabinet Spokesman Minister Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa told journalists at the post-Cabinet meeting media briefing on Tuesday.

He said following the President’s directive, Power Minister Eng. Kumara Jayakody informed the Cabinet of Ministers of the decision and they agreed to act accordingly, ensuring that future renewable energy developments on the island proceed only after meaningful community consultation.
