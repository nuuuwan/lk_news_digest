Brand Finance ranks Bank of Ceylon as Sri Lanka’s Most Valuable Brand in 2025

When Brand Finance Lanka announced its rankings for 2025, Bank of Ceylon (BOC) returned to the top as Sri Lanka’s Most Valuable Brand. The title carries significance beyond prestige. It showcases how an institution is perceived, how it manages its responsibilities, and how its identity connects with both customers and the wider public.

Brand Finance follows internationally recognized valuation methods. Its assessments do not stop at balance sheets. They weigh customer sentiment, marketing strength, governance standards, sustainability commitments, digital engagement, and internal equity. They also capture public perception through surveys that include both customers and non-customers. This wider lens means that a brand is valued not simply for the profits it makes but for how it lives in the minds of people and how it performs across disciplines.

For BOC, the recognition is a return to a position it held consistently for a decade between 2009 and 2019. More importantly, it comes after a six-year gap during which the country faced crises ranging from the Easter Sunday attacks and the COVID-19 pandemic to currency shortages and political turbulence. Throughout these years, BOC remained central to the country’s economic stability, ensuring the import of essential goods, maintaining financial flows, and providing continuity when the system came under strain.
