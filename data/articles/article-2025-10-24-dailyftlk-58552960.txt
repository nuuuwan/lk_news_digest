Chrysalis Chief Executive Officer Ashika Gunasena, was honoured with the Outstanding Contribution to Women MSME Empowerment award at the ‘Women in Management (WIM) MSME Awards 2025’ held on 7 October at Cinnamon Lakeside, Colombo.

The award, presented in the presence of British High Commissioner to Sri Lanka Andrew Patrick, recognises Ashika’s exceptional leadership and Chrysalis’ pivotal role in empowering women-led micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) across the country.

Under Ashika’s guidance, Chrysalis has emerged as one of Sri Lanka’s leading organisations advancing gender equality, inclusive growth and women’s entrepreneurship. Operating across 18 districts, Chrysalis has reached over 210,000 women and youth directly and 9.5 million people indirectly through programs promoting economic empowerment, leadership, and social inclusion.

Through initiatives like ‘Made by Her’ and ‘Advisory Services’, Chrysalis continues to bridge the gap between women entrepreneurs and sustainable market opportunities, combining social purpose with business innovation.

“This award celebrates the spirit of the women we work with—resilient, ambitious, and determined to lead change,” said Ashika Gunasena. “At Chrysalis, we remain committed to creating opportunities where women can thrive as leaders and innovators.”

This recognition reaffirms Chrysalis’ mission to drive inclusive economic growth and champion women’s leadership as a cornerstone of Sri Lanka’s development.
