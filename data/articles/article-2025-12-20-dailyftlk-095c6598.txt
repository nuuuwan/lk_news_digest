Pakistan sends humanitarian relief cargo to Sri Lanka

A consignment of humanitarian relief supplies donated by the Government of Pakistan for disaster relief in Sri Lanka was officially received earlier this week at the Colombo International Container Terminal (CICT), Colombo Port.

The relief cargo was received by Minister of Ports and Civil Aviation, Anura Karunathilake and Deputy Minister of Ports and Civil Aviation, Janitha Ruwan Kodithuwakku, on behalf of the Government of Sri Lanka. The shipment was formally handed over by the Pakistan High Commissioner to Colombo Major General (Retd) Faheem Ul Aziz, representing the Government of Pakistan.

The consignment, dispatched under the coordination of Pakistan’s National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and the Prime Minister’s Office, consists of nearly 200 metric tonnes of humanitarian assistance aimed at supporting communities affected by recent disasters in Sri Lanka

The relief shipment includes family tents, blankets, quilts and bubble mats, providing immediate shelter and warmth to displaced families. The cargo also contains life-saving jackets, inflatable boats, and de-watering pumps, which will strengthen emergency response and rescue operations in flood-affected areas

To address health and nutritional needs, Pakistan has donated medicines, milk powder, therapeutic food (RUTF), mosquito nets and camping lamps, ensuring both medical support and essential supplies for vulnerable populations

Pakistan’s timely assistance is a reflection of the longstanding friendship and solidarity between the two countries and reaffirmed its commitment to standing with Sri Lanka during times of need and supporting ongoing disaster relief and recovery efforts.

The relief items will be distributed through relevant Sri Lankan authorities to affected areas in the coming days, in coordination with disaster management and humanitarian agencies.
