Thimark Technocreations secures export deal with Kenya, showcasing SL engineering exports

In a significant boost for Sri Lanka’s export economy and engineering reputation, Thimark Technocreations (Pvt) Ltd, a locally based ISO 9001:2015 certified engineering firm, has secured a prestigious contract valued at USD 156,000 with the Kenya National Power Company (KenGen). This landmark deal marks a pivotal step in positioning Sri Lanka as a hub for high-value, advanced engineering exports.

The contract entails the design, manufacture, delivery, installation, and commissioning of a state-of-the-art, movable hydraulic trash rack cleaning machine, named the ‘KILGHARRAH 600’. Engineered to meet stringent international standards, this pioneering solution is the first of its kind to be entirely designed and manufactured in Sri Lanka. The machine will play a crucial role in maintaining the efficiency of KenGen’s hydroelectric power infrastructure.

“Winning this project is not only a proud moment for Thimark but also a demonstration of Sri Lanka’s engineering excellence on the global stage,” stated Tharanga Marasinghe, CEO and Managing Director of Thimark Technocreations. “It proves that Sri Lankan companies can design, engineer, and export high-value solutions that meet international standards.”

Thimark’s journey began with specialization in steel fabrication and has since evolved into a diversified engineering powerhouse.

“This export achievement highlights our ability not just to compete but to excel globally,” Marasinghe further stated. “It brings valuable foreign income to Sri Lanka while inspiring confidence in local engineering talent and innovation.”

Building on this momentum, Thimark is preparing to expand into new frontiers, including passenger vehicle development and innovative product solutions for both local and international markets.
