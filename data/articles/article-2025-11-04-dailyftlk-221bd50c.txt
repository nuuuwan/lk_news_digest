Northern Investment Summit 2026: Ladder to prosperity for Sri Lanka’s North

Public and private sectors unite to transform North’s untapped potential into sustainable economic growth

With India’s mentorship and diaspora support, aims to turn collaboration into lasting progress for Sri Lanka’s future

As Sri Lanka prepares for the Northern Investment Summit 2026 (NIS26), questions have emerged over whether this initiative will finally break the cycle of underdevelopment that has long shadowed the Northern Province a region endowed with natural wealth yet lagging behind in national GDP contribution.

Organised by The Management Club (TMC), the summit aims to catalyse growth through investment, innovation and collaboration. Scheduled for 21–22 January 2026 at the Thiruvalluvar Cultural Centre in Jaffna, the event will bring together national and international investors, policymakers and development partners under the theme “Empowering Growth, Driving Innovations.”

TMC President Roger Talayarathna said, “TMC believes in creating platforms that inspire collaboration and action. NIS26 will be a bridge connecting investors, innovators and communities in a shared mission of national growth.”

He also emphasised that this is not just another short-lived initiative but a strategic platform to reposition the Northern Province as a competitive investment and trade hub. Backed by the Government of Sri Lanka, private sector partners and the Sri Lankan diaspora, NIS26 seeks to create a sustainable investment ecosystem that transforms the region’s abundant resources—from agriculture and fisheries to tourism and renewable energy—into engines of growth.

At the launch at the Cinnamon Grand Colombo yesterday, TMC also unveiled the official logo of NIS26, a symbol inspired by spiritual unity and renewal. Rendered in the vibrant hues of the Sri Lankan flag, the design embodies optimism, resilience and the promise of a new beginning for the Northern Province.

TMC Project Chair Indhra K. Rajapaksa said, “This summit is the culmination of years of dialogue and vision. It’s about creating real, measurable impact-turning talk into tangible transformation.”

When asked whether this will simply be another “failed plan,” Rajapaksa said, “The Northern Province has the resources, resilience and talent. What it needs is opportunity—and this summit will deliver just that.”

The initiative has received the backing of Industry and Entrepreneurship Development Minister Sunil Handunnetti who underscored the Government’s commitment to supporting equitable growth and industrial revival across all provinces. Representatives from all five districts of the Northern Province—Jaffna, Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu, Vavuniya and Mannar—have also pledged their cooperation. The respective Government Agents from each district were present at the event, affirming their readiness to facilitate investment and development projects that align with local priorities.

India’s significant role in mentoring and supporting the project was also highlighted, with Indian institutions and investors expected to play a major part in infrastructure, trade and human capital development.

Board of Investment (BOI) Director General Renuka Weerakone affirmed, “Investors are looking for stability, opportunity and innovation. The North offers all three—and the BOI is committed to ensuring that every investment leads to inclusive growth.”

Northern Province Governor Nagalingam Vedanayagam said, “The Northern Province stands at the threshold of transformation. NIS26 is not merely a conference—it is a movement to restore opportunity, dignity and prosperity to our people.”

Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority Tourism Planning Development and Investor Relations Director Dr. Prasad Jayasuriya said, “Tourism has the power to connect communities, cultures and commerce. Through the Northern Investment Summit, we aim to showcase the North as Sri Lanka’s next frontier for sustainable and experiential tourism.”

Export Development Board Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Mangala Wijesinghe added, “Our focus is to help northern entrepreneurs reach global markets. With the right support and innovation, the North can emerge as an export powerhouse for Sri Lanka.”

National Enterprise Development Authority (NEDA) Chairman Laxhman Abeysekara said, “Entrepreneurship is the heartbeat of economic renewal. Our role is to empower small and medium enterprises in the North to become job creators and change-makers.”

Jaffna Government Agent M. Pirratheepan emphasised, “Our people have the talent and tenacity. What they need now is the right environment and investment to unlock full potential. NIS26 will help us build that foundation.”

University of Vavuniya Vice Chancellor Prof. A. Atputharaja said, “Education and innovation are the twin engines of progress. Our universities hope to stand ready to provide the research, skills and human capital needed to drive northern development.”

NIS26 will showcase new policy incentives, bankable projects and investment-ready opportunities aimed at attracting both local and foreign capital. With over 400 delegates expected, the summit will include B2B sessions, project exhibitions and discussions addressing critical challenges—including land access infrastructure and employment generation.

East India Holdings CEO Janek Jayasekera said, “Balanced regional development is essential to Sri Lanka’s long-term renewal. The Northern Province holds immense promise in enterprise, education and sustainable industries. Through partnerships that empower local communities, we can preserve the region’s proud heritage while driving progress.”

The initiative also plans to establish a permanent Northern Investment Forum and a digital platform to track progress and connect investors with real-time opportunities. This, according to TMC, will ensure long-term results rather than one-off promises.

TMC Jaffna Chairman Anu Rakavan said, “The North’s renaissance will be driven by its own people. This summit is about ownership, empowerment and long-term collaboration—not dependency. The Northern Province is richly endowed with resources and a resilient people with the right partnerships, it can become a powerhouse for Sri Lanka’s economic revival.”

Hatton National Bank (HNB) Managing Director/CEO Damith Pallewatte said, “Finance must fuel transformation. HNB is proud to partner in this initiative to ensure that capital flows where it matters most—into the hands of entrepreneurs and visionaries shaping the North’s future.”
