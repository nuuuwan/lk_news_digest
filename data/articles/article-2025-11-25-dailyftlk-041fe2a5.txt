Cleantech Ltd., reaffirmed its longstanding core commitment to environmental stewardship and innovative circular economy efforts as the Gold sponsor at the 10th anniversary celebration of Biodiversity Sri Lanka (BSL) under the theme “LIFE 2025 – Business for Biodiversity”. It was commemorated as a three-day event that brought together leaders from the corporate, policy, and conservation sectors to explore pathways for a greener economy.

As Gold sponsor and a Presenting Partner, Cleantech’s philosophy of aligning business growth with circular economy as mutually reinforcing driving forces of sustainable development was further emphasised at the event, which was held from 24 till 26 September.

The sessions at the event featured technical forums, keynote addresses, and exhibitions, showcasing how organisations and companies are embedding ecological considerations into their operational and investment frameworks, while bringing together private sector leaders, academia and policy institution representatives.

One of the key discussions of the event focused on the pressing issue of financing the Plastic Revolution, bringing together experts and practitioners to address how financing models, plastic credit mechanisms, and policy frameworks can accelerate circularity in Sri Lanka.

Representing Cleantech, Assistant General Manager – Circular Economy and Resource Recovery Eng. Kasun Thennakoon contributed his perspective on operational realities and policy needs within the local plastic waste management sector.

“The largest gap in plastic waste management lies in the lack of interconnected responsibilities supported by a proper legislative framework,” he stated. “The upcoming Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) system is expected to bridge most of these gaps, ensuring shared accountability between producers, recyclers, and waste handlers.”

His insights reinforced Cleantech’s ongoing advocacy for cohesive systems that integrate regulation, private sector accountability, and community participation to drive sustainable change.

At the event, Cleantech demonstrated its role not only as a market leader in sustainable waste management, but also as a proactive contributor to Sri Lanka’s environmental dialogue. The company’s engagement throughout “LIFE 2025” reflected its belief in collaboration by building bridges between the corporate sector, environmental institutions, and policymakers to co-create low-waste ecosystems.

At the core of Cleantech’s environmental sustainability mission lies its flagship initiative, “Re-Circle by Cleantech”, an integrated plastic waste management program designed to transform discarded plastics into valuable resources. Through its closed-loop model, Cleantech collects, recycles, and reproduces materials using 100% post-consumer plastic, ensuring that waste finds its way back into the production cycle rather than the environment. Re-Circle has also brought transparency and traceability to the entire plastic recovery chain through digitised systems. This system has strengthened accountability and has positioned Cleantech as a benchmark for the evolving circular economy landscape of Sri Lanka.

Cleantech, as a company deeply invested in developing scalable waste management systems and promoting responsible resource recovery, exhibited its sustainable solutions and circular economy models at the exhibition stall, which drew engagement and attention from the attendees representing diverse industries and policy institutions.

This partnership with Biodiversity Sri Lanka symbolises Cleantech’s core vision of embedding circular economy consciousness into business strategy, thus turning sustainability from a corporate ideal into measurable, operational reality.

With internationally recognised certifications including ISO 9001, ISO 14001, ISO 45001, Zero Waste to Landfill, GP certificate, Global Recycling Standards and BIR Gold Membership, Cleantech upholds the top global standards in quality, environmental performance, and occupational health and safety, while standing for a cleaner, greener tomorrow.
