HNB Assurance partners Dialog Finance to drive digital payment transformation

HNB Assurance PLC has entered into a strategic partnership with Dialog Finance PLC, a pioneer in digital financial solutions, to further enhance its digital payment infrastructure and accelerate its journey towards achieving 100% digital premium collection.

This collaboration marks a significant milestone in HNB Assurance’s digital transformation journey, reflecting the company’s continuous commitment to improving customer convenience, operational efficiency and financial inclusivity. By integrating Dialog Finance’s advanced Genie Business platform, which includes Payment Links and Internet Payment Gateway (IPG) services, HNB Assurance aims to streamline its premium collection process and redefine how customers interact with insurance services.

Through these solutions, customers will now be able to make payments effortlessly and securely, either through personalized payment links shared by HNB Assurance or via secure online gateways. This eliminates the need for manual or in-person transactions, ensuring instant payment acknowledgments, and offers customers a faster, safer, and more convenient experience.

This partnership leveraging innovation and technology not only strengthens the technological backbone of HNB Assurance’s payment ecosystem but also align with the company’s long-term vision of becoming a fully digital insurer, offering end-to-end solutions that meet the evolving needs of modern customers.
