SriLankan Airlines leads digital push to rebuild tourist confidence after cyclone

SriLankan Airlines has launched a targeted international campaign to restore global travel confidence in Sri Lanka following Cyclone Ditwah. The month-long digital promotion, which began on December 16, 2025, aims to reaffirm the country’s readiness to welcome visitors during the peak travel season.

The campaign will run across Meta and Google platforms, specifically targeting audiences in key markets such as Europe (London, Paris, Frankfurt), Australia, and Pan-India. It is projected to reach over four million potential travellers who have shown interest in visiting Sri Lanka or similar destinations.

As the national carrier, SriLankan Airlines is positioning itself at the forefront of destination recovery. The initiative leverages the airline’s continued stable flight operations and international routes to provide tangible proof that Sri Lanka remains safe, accessible, and open for tourism.

“In the immediate aftermath of the cyclone, restoring traveller confidence is critical,” said Dimuthu Tennakoon, Head of Commercial at SriLankan Airlines. “This campaign proactively reassures global audiences that Sri Lanka is ready and welcoming. We have both a responsibility and a commercial imperative to lead this recovery.”

The campaign is designed to minimize peak-season cancellations, sustain forward bookings, and stimulate inbound demand by delivering real-time reassurance during the booking consideration window. It directly connects destination promotion with flight purchase opportunities, supporting both airline load factors and broader tourism recovery.

Complementing the digital campaign, SriLankan Airlines has produced a short video showcasing Christmas in Colombo, emphasizing the city’s vibrant and safe atmosphere post-cyclone. The approximately two-minute visual presentation will be disseminated through the airline’s social media channels.

This initiative forms part of the airline’s broader effort to support tourism sector recovery, contribute to foreign exchange inflows, and reinforce long-term destination confidence across international markets.
