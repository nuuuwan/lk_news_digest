Strength in Giving: HUTCH hosts 2nd consecutive blood donation campaign

HUTCH recently brought together staff, stakeholders, and members of the public for its second consecutive blood donation program, reaffirming the company’s commitment to community wellbeing and social responsibility. Conducted in collaboration with the National Blood Transfusion Services, the event provided a safe, hygienic, and supportive environment, ensuring that every donor could participate with confidence and comfort.

The program’s goal was not only to support the national blood supply but also to encourage voluntary participation in an act of profound social responsibility. By opening the initiative to both employees and the wider community, HUTCH fostered unity, empathy, and shared purpose. The campaign demonstrated how small individual contributions can collectively create a powerful impact, saving lives and strengthening Sri Lanka’s healthcare system.

Reflecting on the initiative, HUTCH emphasized that the blood donation program was more than just an event, but a demonstration of the company’s belief in the power of collective responsibility. The initiative aimed to build a culture of care and compassion, both within the workplace and across the wider community, and the company expressed its appreciation for the commitment shown by employees and the public in supporting such a vital cause.

Building on the success of its inaugural campaign, this year’s initiative continues HUTCH’s efforts to embed community engagement into its corporate values. By integrating social responsibility into its culture, HUTCH demonstrates that being a telecom provider is not only about connecting people digitally but also about connecting hearts through acts of kindness and solidarity.
