Supreme Court to hear Shani Abeysekaraâ€™s petitions over 2021 arrest

The Supreme Court yesterday granted leave to proceed with three Fundamental Rights petitions filed by former Criminal Investigation Department (CID) Director Shani Abeysekara and two former CID officers, challenging their arrest by the Colombo Crime Division (CCD) in August 2021.

Abeysekara, along with former CID officers Sugath Mendis and Nawarathne Premarathne, was arrested over allegations of fabricating evidence in the case against former Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Vass Gunawardena.

The petitions claim the arrests were politically motivated and followed an allegedly fabricated case connected to a weapons cache uncovered seven years after the 2013 murder of Mohamed Shyam.

The bench comprising Justices Mahinda Samayawardena, Priyantha Fernando, and Sobitha Rajakaruna granted leave to proceed with all three petitions and scheduled the case for argument on 14 May 2026.

Counsel Shantha Jayawardena, Shehan De Silva, and Hafeel Farisz appeared for the Petitioners, while Sanjeewa Wijewickrema represented former Inspector General of Police (IGP) Deshabandu Thennakoon and Neville De Silva. State Counsel Sajith Bandara appeared on behalf of the Attorney General.
