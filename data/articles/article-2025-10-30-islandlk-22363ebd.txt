DFCC Bank’s Lanka Money Transfer platform wins Silver at NBQSA 2025 for advancing financial inclusion

DFCC Bank’s flagship remittance platform, Lanka Money Transfer (LMT), developed by Synapsys Ltd, has been awarded the Silver Award in the Regional, Rural & Remote Services in Inclusions and Community Services category at the National Best Quality Software Awards (NBQSA) 2025, held recently at the Taj Samudra, Colombo.

The recognition highlights LMT’s role in promoting financial inclusion and ensuring secure, efficient, and affordable remittance access for millions of Sri Lankans working overseas and their families at home. With over three million Sri Lankans living abroad and many of them supporting households in rural areas, LMT serves as a trusted digital channel that connects these communities to the formal banking system.

Developed for DFCC Bank by Synapsys Ltd, the platform has expanded formal remittance access through an increasing network of partner institutions and digital channels, ensuring that more families benefit from safe, convenient, and transparent remittance services.

The award was accepted by Vindya Solangaarachchi, Senior Vice President and Chief Information Officer at DFCC Bank PLC, together with senior representatives from Synapsys Ltd and DFCC Bank.

Anton Arumugam, Senior Vice President – Offshore Banking and Remittance Business Development at DFCC Bank, said, “For many Sri Lankan families, remittances are more than income. They are a foundation of stability and opportunity. Through Lanka Money Transfer, we ensure that these funds reach families securely and affordably, allowing them to participate more fully in the formal economy. This recognition reaffirms DFCC Bank’s ongoing commitment to improving access to financial services and strengthening the economic resilience of our communities.”

Vindya Solangaarachchi, Senior Vice President and Chief Information Officer at DFCC Bank, added, “This achievement reinforces our focus on using technology to serve people better. At DFCC Bank, every digital innovation has one goal – to make banking simpler, safer, and more inclusive. LMT reflects that purpose, bridging distances and enabling families to stay connected financially, wherever they are in the world.”

With approximately 300,000 to 400,000 Sri Lankans leaving for overseas employment annually, the need for reliable and accessible remittance services continues to grow. LMT addresses this by providing convenient overseas remittance channels and seamless, cardless withdrawals for recipients across Sri Lanka.

The NBQSA Awards, organised by the Sri Lanka Section of the BCS (Chartered Institute for IT), celebrate excellence and innovation in software development, with national winners gaining eligibility to represent Sri Lanka at the Asia Pacific ICT Alliance (APICTA) Awards.
