Rajaputhra Foundation, Nawaloka Hospitals partner for free breast cancer awareness and screening

A significant Breast Cancer awareness and screening program was recently held at the Nawaloka Hospitals Auditorium, organized by the Rajaputhra Foundation in partnership with Nawaloka Hospitals Plc. The Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiative successfully provided free services to 2,000 women , offering them vital awareness, screening, and access to treatment bookings.

The founder of the Rajaputhra Foundation, Sajeev Rajaputhra, is the President and CEO of SAS3 Trading Company and Chairman of the Rajaputhra Group of Companies, which oversees an expanding business empire of 11 companies. Born in Sri Lanka, Rajaputhra moved to Japan at age 7 and is now a Japanese citizen holding a Japanese passport.

Rajaputhra recently focused his CSR efforts on broadening awareness of breast cancer and supporting women in gaining knowledge and access to treatment. The urgent need to engage in this cause, he stated, came from a realization that “whatever you may have in life, anything could vanish instantly”. He is particularly keen on providing awareness about early detection and lifestyle care.

The event saw the active participation of Sajeev’s wife, Muthu Rajaputhra, who was recently diagnosed with two lumps. She played a crucial role in assisting women with registration, refreshments, screening, and making necessary doctor bookings. The joint effort by the Rajaputhra Foundation and Nawaloka Hospitals provided an invaluable community service, underscoring the importance of corporate engagement in public health.
