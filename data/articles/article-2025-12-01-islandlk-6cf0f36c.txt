The folly of imported ignorance: Why Sri Lanka must reject the foreign anti-vaccine delusion

For decades on end, Sri Lanka has stood as a global beacon of public health success. Our nation’s commitment to comprehensive, routine immunisation has cultivated a shield against catastrophic diseases, resulting in one of the highest vaccination coverage rates in the world. This is a profound, hard-won victory, achieved through the diligent work of our healthcare professionals and the common-sense trust of the people of our nation.

Yet, a dark, utterly ill-informed wave of anti-science propaganda is now crashing upon our shores, primarily driven by the most dangerous kind of imported ignorance: the celebrity-endorsed, politically-charged vaccine hesitancy emanating from the United States of America. We are witnessing the spectacle of high-profile American political figures, completely divorced from scientific reality, attempting to dismantle public health achievements across the globe, including our own. This is not a harmless debate; it is an assault on our children’s lives and a direct threat to the herd immunity that protects our entire society.

Let us first establish the facts, a concept that those in the anti-vaccine movement treat with utter contempt. Despite sustained attempts to discredit us on many a front, including allegations denoting us as a barbaric race, Sri Lanka is recognised worldwide as the ultimate triumph of a Public Health System that has gained so very much and shown sterling results with extremely limited resources.

Sri Lanka’s vaccination programme, run by the Epidemiology Unit and the Ministry of Health, is a model of efficiency and unbelievable coverage. While recent figures show South Asia’s DTP and measles coverage regionally surpassing pre-COVID levels, Sri Lanka’s individual data is a testament to extraordinary efforts. For routine childhood vaccines like BCG, DTP, and the first dose of Measles-Containing Vaccine (MCV1), coverage percentages consistently hover at 97 – 99%. Our nation achieved measles elimination status in 2019, a monumental milestone that few nations can claim.

This success is measured in children who did not die, in families who were not devastated, and in the sheer economic productivity saved by avoiding mass epidemics. Our high coverage is the very definition of a functioning society, placing public welfare above individual paranoia.

The notion that Sri Lanka is entirely immune to the insidious poison of anti-vaccine ideology is, sadly, a dangerous fantasy. The small, vocal lobby of vaccine-hesitant individuals that persists here has already inflicted real-world harm in real time. That Canary in the Coal Mine is the recent outbreak of measles in Sri Lanka.

The measles outbreak that emerged in mid-2023 was a direct consequence of localised pockets of low vaccination coverage, primarily driven by vaccine refusal. Epidemiological studies from the Colombo district, the initial epicentre, revealed a staggering truth. The majority (over 81%) of confirmed cases were among unvaccinated individuals. Measles, an extremely contagious, serious disease, exploits these gaps in coverage like a predator. The outbreak was a stark reminder that even a near-perfect system is only as strong as its weakest link.

While our health authorities, with their incredibly rapid response and supplementary immunisation activities, quickly contained the crisis, the fact remains that measles was reintroduced and spread by the selfish decision by a few to refuse a proven and very safe medical intervention. This local failure to vaccinate has had devastating global parallels, yet nowhere is the absurdity more evident than in the self-inflicted wounds of wealthy Western developed nations.

The ignorance of the American Anti-Vax Crusade is almost unbelievable, except for the fact that it is a real-world occurrence. In sharp contrast to Sri Lanka’s hard-won victories, the US and parts of Europe are now grappling with resurgent vaccine-preventable diseases. This is, unfortunately, the same environment that breeds the self-appointed gurus of health misinformation; uninformed, loud, and often politically-motivated individuals whose public platforms far outweigh their intellectual or scientific credibility.

The rise of the anti-vaccine movement in the USA is a perfect storm of privilege, pervasive social media misinformation, and deep-seated political distrust. It takes a society sheltered from the devastating reality of diseases like polio, diphtheria, and measles to invent imaginary threats about their cures. Sadly, leading the charge are people whose sheer ignorance of basic biology and medical research is as breathtaking as their ego.

Donald Trump and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (RFK Jr.) are now the most prominent figures seeking to drag the world back into a ravine of preventable suffering. Their rhetoric is a reckless combination of populist posturing and a complete disregard for the scientific consensus that underpins modern medicine. The Utter Folly of the Autism Canard is like a bolt from the blue. The most insidious weapon wielded by these “misinformed nincompoops” is the utterly discredited, fraudulent lie connecting vaccines to Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).

This falsehood, a dutifully buried lie, now dishonourably resurrected, originated with the disgraced UK physician Andrew Wakefield. His 1998 paper in The Lancet was not just flawed science; it was a deliberate fraud cooked up for financial gain in a lawsuit against vaccine manufacturers. Wakefield was stripped of his medical license, and his paper was fully retracted by the journal; a very rare but definitive symbol of utter condemnation of him as an inhuman beast.

There is no scientific basis for the vaccine-autism link. Decades of rigorous, large-scale, population-based studies, involving millions of children across multiple countries, have all consistently confirmed the same, irrefutable fact: vaccines do not cause autism.

Autism is a neurodevelopmental condition, a developmental difference perhaps, but certainly not a “disease” caused by an external agent like a vaccine. It is present from birth, and its complex aetiology involves genetic and prenatal factors. The notion that a vaccine “gives” a child autism is an insult to developmental biology and a cruel, baseless panic, inflicted on parents of children with confirmed ASD.

The most alarming recent development is the political weaponisation of science within the US federal government. RFK Jr., after being appointed to a key health position, has demonstrated an unprecedented willingness to impose his anti-science dogma on one of the world’s foremost public health agencies, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia.

Under his watch, the CDC’s website was scandalously updated to essentially and shamelessly equivocate on the issue, suggesting that the long-standing, evidence-based claim that “vaccines do not cause autism” is “not an evidence-based claim” because studies have not “ruled out the possibility” entirely. This is a breathtaking display of intellectual dishonesty and scientific illiteracy.

Science does not work by perpetually proving a negative. This reasoning is the equivalent of demanding that the US government confirm that the Moon is not made of cheese because, theoretically, a study has not  conclusively ruled out the existence of interdimensional cheese-producing space goblins. It is an argument based on a logical fallacy, designed only to sow doubt where none exists. This action has rightfully provoked outrage from leading autism advocacy and scientific organisations who recognise it for what it is: the amplification of pseudoscience for political ends.

Finally, we need to consider why Sri Lanka Must Hold the Line. The battle against vaccine misinformation is not just a scientific one; it is a moral and political imperative for our nation. In such a perspective, we need to consider several aspects of a quandary of possible misfortunes.

We need to fervently protect our Public Health Infrastructure. Our success is a precious national resource. To compromise our high vaccination rates for the sake of embracing a discredited, fraudulent, and politically-motivated American conspiracy theory would be an act of staggering national self-sabotage.

We need to roundly reject Imported Arrogance. We must firmly reject the conceited notion that the chaotic, evidence-free, “debate” in the USA has any relevance, whatsoever, to our established, successful public health policy. Sri Lanka does not need to import their crises.

Then there is the spectre of the Ethics of a Community. Our national success is built on the principle of community responsibility. Vaccination is an altruistic act; it is the fundamental duty of every parent to protect not only their children but also the infants, the elderly, and the immunocompromised who rely on the safety net of herd immunity. Those who refuse vaccines for their children become free-riders on the vaccinated majority, putting vulnerable lives at risk.

This newspaper article is a Call to Defiance: Do Not Let the Nincompoops Win. To the few in Sri Lanka who find themselves swayed by the utter ignorance emanating from the USA political sphere, look at the verifiable evidence, not the self-serving, non-expert rhetoric. Look at our country’s history of disease control, and certainly not at the well-planned scientific fraud of a disgraced, fraudulent doctor from two decades ago.

* Autism is NOT a vaccine injury. It is a facet of human diversity of a developmental nature. It just cannot be something that is CAUSED by ANYTHING after birth.

* The evidence is overwhelming and conclusive. The vaccine-autism link is a lie, a medical fraud, and a cruel distraction from real healthcare needs.

* The stakes are too high. The potential consequences of listening to these villains of the piece are not an abstract political talking point; they are outbreaks, lifelong disabilities, and even death.

Sri Lanka, with its proven track record and a people who have demonstrated their trust in the institutions that keep them safe, must stand firm. We must recognise the American anti-vaccine movement for what it is: a disastrous, politically-motivated fantasy that threatens to undo global progress. We must not allow the misinformed lackeys from the West to upset our applecart of public health excellence. Our children’s future, and indeed, our national security against disease, demands nothing less than an absolute, unwavering allegiance to science, truth, and responsibility.
