Unit Trust Association of Sri Lanka launches “Investor Awareness Initiative” to empower public to build wealth through Unit Trusts

The Unit Trust Association of Sri Lanka (UTASL) has launched an Investor Awareness Initiative aimed at helping Sri Lankans understand how Unit Trusts (UTs) can play a vital role in planning and growing their wealth. The initiative will take place at the World Trade Centre, Colombo, from 27th to 31st October 2025, where there will be 16 member companies participating in the awareness programme.

While Unit Trusts are one of the most widely used and trusted investment tools globally, awareness and participation among Sri Lankan investors remain relatively low. UTASL’s latest initiative seeks to change that by making the concept of Unit Trusts simple, relatable, and accessible to everyone, from first-time investors to those seeking to diversify their savings. This public education drive supports the ongoing efforts of the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka (SEC) and the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) to strengthen financial literacy and investor participation across the country.

The launch of this initiative comes at a time of renewed confidence and growth in the Unit Trust industry. As of August 2025, total assets under management reached Rs. 601 billion, and the number of unit holders climbed to 131,609, reflecting an increase of 16,972 new investors and Rs. 56.4 billion in funds within the year. This growth signals a significant shift in investor behaviour, with more Sri Lankans beginning to look beyond traditional savings accounts toward professionally managed investment options that offer stability, transparency, and long-term returns.

Speaking on the initiative, Christine Dias Bandaranaike, President UTASL, said, “For Sri Lanka’s economy to grow sustainably, people must begin to think like investors, not just savers. Unit Trusts make this transition easier. Professionals, regulated by the SEC, manage Unit Trusts, and are accessible to anyone who wants to start building wealth systematically. Our campaign’s central message is Dhanaya Wadana UT (Wealth Building UT), with which we hope to encourage Sri Lankans to take control of their financial future through disciplined, long-term investing in regulated Unit Trusts.”

The public engagement event at the World Trade Centre, Colombo, is from the 27th to the 31st of October, providing a unique opportunity for visitors to engage directly with licensed fund managers and investment experts. This interactive platform allows you to learn about different types of Unit Trusts, such as equity, balanced, and income funds, and discover how small, consistent investments can grow into long-term wealth.

The companies participating in the Investor Awareness initiative are leaders in the industry, each bringing their unique expertise and commitment to wealth building. These include Arpico Ataraxia Asset Management (Private) Limited, Asia Securities Wealth Management (Pvt) Ltd, Asset Trust Management (Pvt) Ltd, Assetline Capital (Pvt) Ltd, Capital Alliance Investments Ltd, Ceybank Asset Management (Pvt) Limited, Ceylon Asset Management Company Limited, CT Smith Asset Management (Private) Limited, First Capital Asset Management Limited, J B Financial (Pvt) Ltd, LYNEAR Wealth Management (Pvt) Limited, National Asset Management Limited, NDB Wealth Management Limited, Premier Wealth Management Ltd, Senfin Asset Management (Pvt) Ltd, and Softlogic Asset Management (Pvt) Ltd.

UTASL aims to popularise Unit Trusts and inspire Sri Lankans to prioritise long-term, professionally guided investing over short-term savings. The core message of “Dhanaya Wadana UT” will empower Sri Lankans to control their financial future and contribute to national economic growth.
