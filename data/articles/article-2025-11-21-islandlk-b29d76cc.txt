Green Tape powers 10,000th digital tender, driving ‘a new era of transparent procurement in Sri Lanka’

Platform has already processed more than Rs. 30 billion in procurements

Green Tape, Sri Lanka’s cutting-edge integrated digital procurement ecosystem, has reached a major milestone with the execution of its 10,000th tender; underscoring the growing shift toward transparent, accountable, and sustainable business practices.

The tender, for the supply of electronics and computer hardware, was called by Alliance Finance Company PLC, and the successful bidder was Leosys Corporation, which joined the platform in late 2024.

The surpassing of 10,000 digitally-executed tenders highlights Green Tape’s growing role in reshaping procurement, a sector long plagued by inefficiency, opacity, and malpractice; and affirms the SaaS procurement solution as a Sri Lankan success story of global relevance.

Since launch, Green Tape has facilitated over Rs. 30 billion in procurement, and has linked more than 50 buyers, including 20 Tier I corporates, with over 4,500 suppliers across agriculture, apparel, construction, insurance, IT, packaging, and professional services.
