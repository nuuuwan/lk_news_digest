Sky Gallery Presents ‘Her Face, Her Power’ Portraits of Women by Gustav Klimt and Frida Kahlo

A Landmark Exhibition Exploring Female Identity, Strength, and Spirit Through the Eyes of Two Masters

Sky Gallery is proud to present, this groundbreaking presentation, which brings together a curated selection of portraits from two revolutionary artists of the 20th century. Gustav Klimt’s gilded elegance and symbolic sensuality meet Frida Kahlo’s raw introspection and cultural defiance, offering visitors a layered experience of feminine power across time and style. The exhibition challenges the traditional male gaze, instead presenting women as the authors of their own identity—be it through Klimt’s external idealization or Kahlo’s internal excavation. On view is an extraordinary collection of life-sized, museum-quality canvas portraits that immortalize the spirit, strength, and sensuality of women as seen through the eyes of these masters.

Though separated by generation and geography, Gustav Klimt (Austria, 1862–1918) and Frida Kahlo (Mexico, 1907–1954) shared a fascination with the female form and psyche. Klimt, the master of the Viennese Secession, portrayed women as ethereal, symbolic, and often enveloped in a cosmos of gold leaf and pattern. Kahlo, on the other hand, turned her unflinching gaze inward, using self-portraiture to explore themes of pain, identity, politics, and cultural heritage with visceral honesty. ‘Her Face, Her Power’ explores the feminine form not as an object, but as a vessel of resilience, identity, and creative energy.

The exhibition includes a selection of Gustav Klimt’s mesmerizing portraits, showcasing his signature use of gold leaf, intricate patterns, and allegorical symbolism that redefined female beauty at the turn of the century and, a powerful collection of Frida Kahlo’s self-portraits, revealing her exploration of physical and emotional suffering, her vibrant Mexican identity, and her indomitable spirit.

At first glance, Klimt and Kahlo may seem like an unlikely pairing, but their work converges on a central theme: the immense power and complexity of the female experience. This is not only about viewing art; it’s about witnessing a conversation across time about identity, adornment, pain, and ultimately, power. Klimt and Kahlo both painted women not as muses, but as mirrors — reflecting desire, defiance, and deep inner worlds. This exhibition is a tribute to that gaze — powerful, vulnerable, and utterly human.

‘Her Face, Her Power’ continues Sky Gallery’s mission to bring world art closer to local audiences, this time inviting reflection on how feminine identity and artistic vision intertwine across eras and continents. Each portrait in this exhibition has been reproduced in breathtaking detail from the original works, presented on life-sized framed canvases that honor the original dimensions and textures. Visitors will journey from the sensual, decorative allure of Klimt’s subjects to the raw, autobiographical narrative of Kahlo’s work.

Opening on Friday 14thNovember, the exhibition continues until Sunday 23rdNovember – 10 AM – 5PM each day.
