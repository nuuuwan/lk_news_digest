Loyalty and rewards management platform CH17 Loyalty, has announced its partnership with menswear brand – Signature. CH17 Loyalty CEO Jumar Preena said this collaboration marks yet another step forward in CH17’s mission to deliver unmatched privileges and lifestyle experiences to its growing base of discerning members.

CH17 Loyalty is built on the principle of understanding customer behaviour and aligning rewards with real needs. Menswear remains a high-demand category within Sri Lanka’s retail landscape, particularly among young professionals, executives, and the aspirational middle class.

By bringing Signature into its partner network, CH17 directly addresses this demand, offering its cardholders access to premium menswear at the right price point. The partnership ensures that CH17’s members enjoy value without compromise—with Signature’s reputation for impeccable tailoring, contemporary designs, and durability reinforcing that promise.

Signature has become synonymous with affordability with quality and is the go-to choice for the busy corporate executive who requires style and comfort at the best price. Beyond the corporate office environment, the brand has also earned recognition in the sports arena with the endorsement of Sri Lanka’s Cricket’s both men and women national teams, who look elegant and smart on Signature smart casual wear. Beyond cricket the brand also has a stake in rugby and hockey.

This unique positioning—bridging professional wear with lifestyle apparel—aligns perfectly with CH17’s philosophy of rewarding loyalty with brands that inspire trust and admiration.

This collaboration between Signature and CH17 Loyalty is not just about discounts—it’s about creating an aspirational lifestyle ecosystem where loyalty is rewarded with brands that matter. By weaving together consumer insights, retail value, and digital innovation, CH17 continues to lead the loyalty and rewards space in Sri Lanka, added Preena.
