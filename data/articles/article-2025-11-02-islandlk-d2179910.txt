A new chapter for Sri Lankan driving: Global icon GWM arrives with a trusted partner

‘DPA prioritised long-term customer assurance over a rushed market entry’

A new, formidable partnership is set to reshape Sri Lanka’s automotive landscape. David Pieris Automobiles (DPA), a name synonymous with trust and reliability in the island’s vehicle market, has officially joined forces with GWM, a global automotive icon, to bring a new generation of hybrid and new energy vehicles to Sri Lankan roads.

This strategic alliance, announced at a press conference at the DPA Head Office, brings together GWM’s international engineering prowess with DPA’s unwavering four-decade commitment to customer service. For Sri Lankans, this means soon having the opportunity to own a vehicle from a world-class company, backed by the nation’s most reliable reseller.

While several brands have entered the new energy vehicle segment, this partnership stands apart due to its profound preparation. DPA’s Group Chairman, Rohana Dissanayake, emphasised that their commitment extends far beyond the showroom. “David Pieris Automobiles is well-known for its reliability and accessibility of our After-Sales Service,” he stated, revealing that a dedicated service centre for GWM is already established at Hyde Park Corner. With technical teams fully trained and a efficient spare parts supply chain in place, Dissanayake confidently assured that DPA is ‘fully poised’ to provide after-sales-service in the best possible manner.”

Mahesh Gunathilake, Executive Director of DPA highlighted GWM’s remarkable global footprint, with a presence in over 170 countries, including the highly demanding markets of Australia, Europe, and the Americas. Its position as a Fortune 500 company and a top-ranked automaker in China underscores the quality and innovation Sri Lankan drivers can now access.

Crucially, DPA prioritised this long-term customer assurance over a rushed market entry. Gunathilake explained that the company deliberately delayed the launch to first build a robust support ecosystem. “We would have been able to bring this vehicle earlier if we had not prioritized our focus on training our technicians beforehand,” he noted, ensuring that every customer’s investment is protected from day one.

“This collaboration is more than just a new line of cars; it’s a movement towards intelligent mobility. It promises Sri Lankans more freedom, more efficiency, and above all, more trust. The road ahead is now clear for drivers to embrace a smarter future, powered by a global icon and grounded by a local giant,” Yasantha Abeykoone, Head of Sales and Marketing of DPA said.
