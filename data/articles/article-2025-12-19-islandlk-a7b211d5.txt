HNB strengthens national response to Cyclone Ditwah

HNB PLC has contributed of Rs. 100 million towards the Rebuild Sri Lanka Fund, reinforcing its commitment to national recovery efforts following the devastation caused by Cyclone Ditwah.

“On behalf of HNB, I wish to convey our solidarity with all our fellow Sri Lankans, especially those severely affected by Cyclone Ditwah. As a home-grown institution, our connection to the communities we serve runs deep. Many of our customers and colleagues have been directly or indirectly affected, and we are committed to standing with them during this difficult time and supporting them as they rebuild.”

“HNB’s contribution to the Rebuild Sri Lanka Fund is a sign of our commitment to this collective mission. We recognize that this is going to be a long and challenging process, but we stand ready and committed to support both the immediate and long-term recovery effort,” HNB Managing Director/ CEO, Damith Pallewatte stated.

Complementing its direct financial support to the Fund, HNB has also launched a nationwide disaster relief initiative as the first phase of a broader, coordinated response from the bank.

As part of the program, the Bank donated over 2,500 essential relief and nutrition packages to support displaced families, with the consignments formally handed over to the Sri Lanka Army to ensure structured, transparent, and equitable distribution across the impacted areas of Kandy, Gampaha, Kaduwela, and Hanwella, while separate packages were provided to affected employees to strengthen their personal recovery.
