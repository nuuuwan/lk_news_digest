UAE extends urgent humanitarian aid to flood-stricken Sri Lanka

Sri Lanka’s Ambassador to United Arab Emirates Arusha Cooray expresses deep appreciation to President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, senior officials and multiple organisations

In a demonstration of solidarity and compassion, the United Arab Emirates has launched an urgent humanitarian response to support Sri Lanka as it deals with devastating floods and landslides. Acting under the directives of President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the UAE has mobilised resources and expertise to assist communities affected by the disaster.

Through the Joint Operations Command, the UAE Aid Agency, the UAE Red Crescent and UAE’s Urban Search and Rescue have coordinated a swift relief mission, deploying specialised search and rescue teams from the Abu Dhabi Civil Defence Authority. These highly trained professionals, equipped with boats and advanced rescue gear, have joined local responders in locating trapped individuals, evacuating families, and providing critical medical care in the hardest hit regions. Their arrival has brought hope to communities facing challenges.

The UAE’s response also includes the rapid delivery of emergency relief supplies. Six flights have arrived at Bandaranaike International Airport, Katunayake, up until 4 December operated by the UAE Air Force, one of the world’s largest cargo transport planes. The aircrafts contained temporary housing units, food packs, tents, blankets, mattresses, vehicles for rescue teams, and motorbikes designed to navigate difficult terrain. These supplies are being distributed to displaced families across severely impacted districts.

For many Sri Lankan households, the floods have swept away homes, belongings, and livelihoods. The UAE’s aid trucks and aircraft are delivering immediate relief to these desperate families, ensuring access to food, shelter, and essential survival items. Particularly vulnerable groups including children, the elderly, and those with medical needs, are receiving priority assistance. Sri Lanka remains very grateful to the Ambassador of the UAE to Sri Lanka, Khaled Nasser Al Ameri, and the Government of the UAE for the assistance, recognising that such international friendship strengthens ties and resilience and hope during times of crisis.

The Sri Lanka Embassy thanked the UAE’s principled humanitarian policy, which emphasises swift, decisive action in times of global crisis. Rooted in a commitment to uphold human dignity, the UAE has consistently extended its hand to nations in need, regardless of geography. President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan has reaffirmed that the UAE stands firmly with countries confronting emergencies, pledging humanitarian aid.

As Sri Lanka battles the aftermath of its worst flooding in years, the UAE’s timely intervention highlights the enduring bonds of friendship and solidarity between nations. By acting promptly and compassionately, the UAE has alleviated suffering and strengthened the spirit of resilience among those affected. The UAE’s swift humanitarian response embodies the very essence of responsible and forward‑looking global stewardship.
