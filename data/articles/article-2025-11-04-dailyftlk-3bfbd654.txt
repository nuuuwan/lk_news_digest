Sri Lanka–Thailand Business Council holds 24th AGM

The Sri Lanka–Thailand Business Council held its 24th AGM recently with the presence of key stakeholders and members present.

The Council continues to play a pivotal role in strengthening trade, investment, and tourism ties between the two friendly nations. Rooted in centuries of shared cultural and religious heritage, the bond between Sri Lanka and Thailand has evolved into a partnership that blends tradition with modern economic collaboration. The Council, which will celebrate its 25th anniversary next year, has been a cornerstone of this progress, fostering dialogue and cooperation between the private sectors of both countries.

Rizan Nazeer, one of the founding members of the Council, was appointed as its President.

With his long-standing commitment to enhancing Sri Lanka–Thailand relations, Nazeer brings both experience and vision to the role. He stated that the Council has many plans underway to support the government’s efforts to strengthen trade, economic, and tourism relations between the two nations. He also highlighted the significance of the Sri Lanka–Thailand Free Trade Agreement (FTA), signed in February 2024, which aims to eliminate tariffs on nearly 85 percent of traded goods within six years. The agreement, once implemented, is expected to raise bilateral trade, currently valued at around US$350 million, to over a billion dollars in the near future.

He emphasised that the Council’s focus will be on fostering greater private-sector engagement, encouraging joint ventures, and expanding cooperation in key areas such as agriculture, food processing, health and wellness, tourism, renewable energy, and technology. The Council also plans to empower small and medium enterprises by helping them gain access to new markets and meet international quality standards, thereby enabling them to benefit from the opportunities that will arise through enhanced bilateral cooperation.

Over the years, the Sri Lanka–Thailand Business Council has organised numerous business forums, trade missions, and networking events in collaboration with the Board of Trade of Thailand, Thai Sri Lanka Chamber of Commerce and other partners. These initiatives have opened new avenues for business and investment, while also strengthening cultural understanding and people-to-people connections between the two countries.

As the Council approaches its 25th year of dedicated service, it stands as a symbol of enduring friendship and forward-looking cooperation between Sri Lanka and Thailand. Under the leadership of the President and the Executive committee the Council is poised to guide this partnership into a new era of shared prosperity, reinforcing its commitment to economic growth, tourism promotion, and mutual progress for both nations.
