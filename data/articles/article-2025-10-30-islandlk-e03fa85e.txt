Sri Lankan Realtor in the U.S. named among top 1.5% real estate professionals nationwide

Nilmini Senanayake Hecox, a Sri Lankan-born real estate professional based in Denver, Colorado, has been recognized with the prestigious 2025 RealTrends Verified + The Thousand award, placing her among the top 1.5% of real estate professionals in the United States based on closed sales and transaction volume.

Raised in a large extended family in Sri Lanka, Hecox grew up immersed in the traditions of home and community. “I was shaped by an inner knowing that home is where we feel safe, seen, and held,” she reflects. “Whatever was going on in the outside world, I knew that when I stepped inside my grandmother’s house, I could release all emotions and be cared for by my family. That kind of soul-grounding stays with you.”

After a 15-year career in philanthropy, Hecox transitioned into real estate, guided by a serendipitous meeting with the CEO of a boutique brokerage. Real estate, she discovered, was part of her family legacy — her paternal great-grandfather had once owned much of Kandy, securing his family’s future through property investments.

Today, as a Global Real Estate Advisor with LIV Sotheby’s International Realty, she serves clients ranging from first-time buyers to seasoned investors, blending Sri Lankan warmth with data-driven strategy in Denver’s competitive housing market. Her approach emphasizes understanding the dreams and aspirations behind each purchase.

Looking ahead, Hecox envisions bridging best practices between the U.S. and Sri Lanka. “Real estate in Sri Lanka is unregulated, which leaves both clients and agents vulnerable. I hope to one day contribute to creating a framework of trust and ethics there,” she says.

Her recognition on a national platform not only underscores her professional excellence but also shines a spotlight on Sri Lankans excelling globally.
