Saudi Arabia witnesses rare snowfall for first time in 30 years

Snow has blanketed several regions across Saudi Arabia for the first time in 30 years, transforming the desert-framed mountains into a striking winter wonderland as inclement weather made its presence felt.

A cold air mass brought rain and powerful winds, turning higher northern elevations into a snowy landscape. Near Tabuk, in areas like Jabal Al Lawz and the Trojena highlands, temperatures dropped to around -4°C, allowing snow to settle at altitudes near 2,600 metres.

Local TV channels called it a historic event. Social media photos show mountains turn white with snow.

As the snow fell in areas like Tabuk and Hail, the residents stepped out to ski and enjoy the icy scenes.

The rare event has sparked excitement and disbelief among residents who have shared videos and photos of the kingdom blanketed in white.

Snowfall transformed parts of the country into an unexpected winter playground.

A video shared on X captured an unusual scene of a group of camels standing in desert area covered in snow, with dark clouds looming overhead, has gone viral.

Another video showed adults enjoying skiing in the snow, celebrating and capturing a scene rarely seen in the Kingdom.
