Continuing as an Advisor to the Government on Productivity Promotion

LESSONS FROM MY CAREER: SYNTHESISING MANAGEMENT THEORY WITH PRACTICE – PART 27

In the previous article I reflected on the period in my career that shaped my thinking most profoundly, my tenure as Advisor on Productivity to the Ministry of Industrial Development stands out. It was a role I did not pursue. Rather, it came to me because I wrote a newspaper article criticising the newly announced “National Productivity Year.” Instead of reacting defensively, the Ministry invited me to “join and help,” a testament—at least at that moment—to our ability to convert criticism into constructive contribution.

I accepted immediately. The idea of raising Sri Lanka’s productivity was not merely interesting to me; it felt like a national necessity. What unfolded was a chapter rich with lessons: some humorous, some sobering, and many instructive for any country hoping to rise on the strength of discipline, efficiency, and continuous improvement.

The Ministry Secretary soon felt that productivity awareness should begin at the uppermost layers of Government. He arranged for me to address the Development Secretaries, representing ministries central to national development. Their regular meeting was held at the Finance Ministry, and I arrived early to set up my laptop and projector.

One by one, the Secretaries walked in and eyed the setup with suspicion. Their expressions suggested that the last thing they wanted was an outsider lecturing them.

· “We have a full agenda—can you cut this down to a short presentation?”

What began as a 45-minute presentation was reduced to 30, then to 20. It was clear that enthusiasm was in short supply.

It reminded me of a Filipino productivity expert who once joked at a conference that when his presentation time was cut from 45 minutes to 20, he eliminated the content, removed the diagrams, and kept only the jokes. I did not dare adopt that strategy with this audience.

But as I began speaking, their body language changed. They listened. They asked questions. And by the end, most requested copies of my slides. The Ministry Secretary was delighted. I quietly celebrated my first victory: converting scepticism into interest.

The study tour: a tale of two nations doing productivity right

Shortly afterward, a study visit was arranged for the Director General of NIBM, trade unionist Lesley Devendra, and myself. Our destinations were Malaysia and Singapore—two countries that had transformed themselves in a matter of decades. The contrast with Sri Lanka was immediate and stark, offering lessons that remain relevant today.

In both countries, productivity did not float in bureaucratic limbo. It was anchored by political will at the highest level. Annual national themes were selected, cascaded through ministries, and executed with discipline.

A central belief guided their approach: A productive public service is the foundation of a productive private sector. Efficient public institutions remove barriers, reduce delays, and create a conducive environment for businesses to thrive. In contrast, inefficient public institutions can strangle even the most vibrant private sector. This philosophy was evident everywhere we visited.

One of the most impressive elements in Malaysia was the role of its national productivity institution, the Malaysia Productivity Corporation (MPC)—formerly the National Productivity Centre (NPC).

· 1966: Established as NPC, focusing heavily on Japanese-inspired Quality Circles (QCs), worker involvement, and basic productivity tools.

Rebranded as MPC. Its mandate expanded to competitiveness, innovation, business process re-engineering, and benchmarking.

MPC mainstreamed lean, regulatory reform, and national business process improvements.

· 2020s: Emphasis on digital transformation and regulatory efficiency, aiming to position Malaysia among the world’s top 12 most competitive economies by 2030.

This was not a small unit hidden inside a ministry. MPC was a statutory authority with a broad mandate, professional leadership, and continuity across governments.

During our discussions, we were told that all ministries and government departments were required to obtain ISO 9001 certification within that year. Curious, I asked: “What happens if a department fails to get certified by the deadline?” The answer was simple—and rather telling: “That question is irrelevant. When Dr. Mahathir gives a deadline, it is met. Nobody dares to miss it.”

That single line revealed more about the effectiveness of leadership than any management textbook.

We visited several organisations that had won the Prime Minister’s Productivity Award. One memorable visit was to the newly opened North–South Highway. Even the toll booth operators were trained in greeting techniques—and taught how to smile.

My two colleagues insisted that I should take the smiling course, as they felt I looked “too serious.” I promised to consider it, though I suspect they were not entirely joking.

Singapore, as always, operated at a different level of discipline and efficiency. Whether in government offices, transportation systems, or public spaces, the influence of thoughtful design and firm leadership was unmistakable.

At the time, T-shirts bearing the slogan “Singapore is a Fine City” were popular. It was a clever pun—the city was indeed fine, but it was also full of fines:

This philosophy of behavioural discipline permeated daily life. A famous example awaited us at SPRING Singapore.

At SPRING (the then Singapore Productivity and Standards Board), I walked into the restroom and froze at a sign above the toilet: “If you do not flush – S$20 fine.” Just to be safe, I flushed three times. When one of my colleagues asked the presenter, “How do you know who did not flush?” he laughed and said: “Why is it only visiting Sri Lankans who ask that question?”

He explained that the sign was symbolic. No one had ever been fined. The Singaporean ethos is such that people obey rules because it is the right thing to do—not because they fear detection.

Then he added, with a touch of mischief: “Sri Lanka seems to have too many lawyers in powerful positions. Everything becomes about proof and evidence. That mindset slows a nation.” It was his personal opinion, but whether one agrees or not, it certainly gives food for thought.

SPRING Singapore → Enterprise Singapore: The Evolution of a Productivity Powerhouse

· 1972: Establishment of the Singapore Productivity Board to modernise businesses and train the workforce.

Merger with the Singapore Institute of Standards and Industrial Research (SISIR) to form the Singapore Productivity and Standards Board (PSB).

PSB rebranded as SPRING Singapore, standing for Standards, Productivity, Innovation, and Growth—a strategic combination under one umbrella.

· 2018: Merger with IE Singapore to form Enterprise Singapore, a powerful institution overseeing standards, productivity, SME growth, and internationalisation.

When we visited, the institution was still known as PSB. Yet its professionalism and clarity of mandate were already world-class. The Government ensured it had authority, funding, and governance. It was designed to shape the nation’s future—not merely react to it.

Returning to Sri Lanka, I reflected on what we had seen. Malaysia had MPC. Singapore had PSB/SPRING. Both were statutory bodies with strong mandates, continuity, autonomy, and authority to drive national change.

Sri Lanka had the National Productivity Secretariat (NPS)—a small unit buried within a ministry, lacking statutory power, authority, or permanence.

We made strong recommendations to elevate it into a statutory body, widen its mandate, and resource it adequately. Later, I even produced a comprehensive proposal for the Asian Productivity Organisation (APO) recommending its transformation. Nothing happened.

This passive neglect remains one of the quiet tragedies of Sri Lanka’s long struggle for competitiveness.

Inside the Ministry, we slowly began building the identity of the NPS. With no legal recognition, we nonetheless adopted the name “National Productivity Secretariat.” A Steering Committee guided us, but reaching consensus was often an uphill battle.

A perfect example was the struggle to design a logo. One member proposed a tree full of fruits.

Another wanted the “4Ms”—man, machine, money, and methods. The understanding of modern logo design was lacking. The debate dragged on for months.

Realising the stalemate, I approached an advertising agency to create a few designs—on a pro bono basis. I selected one, explained its symbolism to the Minister, and obtained his approval.

Back at the Steering Committee, I simply said: “The Minister has approved this design. Shall we therefore adopt it?” Unanimous approval. The logo still used today was born that way—a reminder that sometimes leadership requires gentle manoeuvring rather than rigid process.

This chapter of my life yielded strong beliefs that remain with me—and are especially relevant for Sri Lankan policy makers today.

Singapore and Malaysia show that productivity cannot be delegated to minor units. It must be a national mission backed by the highest leadership.

A small secretariat cannot transform a nation. Sri Lanka needs a statutory productivity authority with teeth, continuity, and independence.

A slow or inefficient public sector is a hidden tax on every business. Productivity must start at the top.

Whether flushing a toilet or meeting a deadline, national development is built on the small habits of citizens and officials.

Malaysia enforced ISO certification. Singapore enforced Quality Circles. Clear deadlines, enforced with consequences, drive change.

My experience as Advisor strengthened my conviction that productivity is not a technical concept. It is a national attitude. Countries that rise—Japan, Singapore, Malaysia—treat productivity as a permanent national priority, supported by robust institutions and decisive leadership.

Sri Lanka has immense potential. But potential alone does not create prosperity. What we need is commitment, continuity, discipline, and the courage to implement reforms even when they are uncomfortable.

As I continue to write these memoirs, I hope that the lessons captured here will inform future leaders and inspire them to act decisively—so that Sri Lanka, too, can write its own story of transformation
