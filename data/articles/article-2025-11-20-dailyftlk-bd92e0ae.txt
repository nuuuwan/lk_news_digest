Green gram purchasing initiative gets Rs. 764 m boost

The Cabinet of Ministers on Monday approved the allocation of funds to purchase the green gram harvest in competition with the private sector, further expanding the Government’s existing procurement program.

Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa, addressing the weekly post-Cabinet media briefing yesterday said Rs. 764 million had been set aside for the initiative.

Under the 2025 Green Gram Crop Productivity and Production Enhancement Program, implemented in line with the guidelines of the Agriculture, Livestock, Land, and Irrigation Ministry, green gram was cultivated on around 16,500 hectares during the 2025 Yala and intermediate seasons. This cultivation was expected to yield around 14,600 tons, with roughly 12,000 tons anticipated to reach the local market.

Harvesting had already begun in the Hambantota district, where reports indicated that middlemen were purchasing produce at a low price of Rs. 450 per kilogram.

“To ensure that farmers received a fair price, the National Food Promotion Board, acting on the advice of the Ministry, began purchasing the green gram harvest directly from farmers,” he said. The proposal to this effect was presented by Agriculture, Livestock, Land, and Irrigation Minister K.D. Lalkantha.
