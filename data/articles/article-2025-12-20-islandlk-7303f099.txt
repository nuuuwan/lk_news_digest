Sampath Bank Expands Sustainable Mobility Access Through Strategic Partnership with Hayleys Mobility

Sampath Bank PLC recently entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Hayleys Mobility Limited, the mobility arm of Hayleys Fentons Limited, at the Bank’s Head Office, marking a significant step towards enhancing access to advanced sustainable mobility solutions in Sri Lanka.

Focusing on sustainability and accessibility, Hayleys Mobility has introduced a New Energy Vehicle line-up featuring globally renowned brands OMODA&JAECOO, a premium New Energy Vehicle (NEV) brand in the passenger vehicle category, and SRM, one of the most sought-after commercial electric truck brands in Singapore. The newly introduced JAECOO J8, JAECOO J7 PHEV, JAECOO J6, and OMODA E5 offer customers a choice between fully electric and plug-in hybrid SUVs that cater to diverse lifestyles and driving preferences.

Through this agreement, Sampath Bank aims to strengthen the ownership experience for customers by extending a series of financial benefits designed to make the purchase process more accessible. Eligible customers will be entitled to a reduction of 0.5% per annum from the published interest rate when obtaining a vehicle lease, subject to rules, regulations and restrictions applicable to Sampath Bank. The Bank will also offer loans to pay the vehicle insurance premium, and no interest will be charged if the insurance loan is settled within two months. In addition, customers introduced by Hayleys Mobility may obtain Sampath Bank credit cards with no joining fee, while insurance payments made through the card will be eligible for a 0% interest plan over twelve months.

Hayleys Mobility complements these financial solutions by offering full manufacturer warranties, certified after-sales support, genuine parts, and 24/7 roadside assistance via its official hotline, 0112 222 222. Further strengthening its commitment to reliable sustainable mobility, the company is expanding access to dependable EV charging through its partnership with StarCharge, a global leader in electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure and microgrid solutions.

The collaboration brings together Sampath Bank’s financial expertise and Hayleys Fentons’ 106-year engineering legacy in bringing the latest technologies to Sri Lanka, offering customers an attractive proposition for innovative, future-ready mobility with practical financial support.
