A Review — Uprooted By Ana Pararajasingham: “Uprooted Yet Unbroken”

There are no winners in war, only survivors. The Tamil diaspora is one of the many survivors of the Sri Lankan war.  Since we arrived on friendly shores, we have been living in two worlds. One with loss, grief, and haunting memories. And the other with peace, prosperity and profit. One is painful, and the other is gratifying.

Like me, many Tamils often struggle to reconcile between the two.

But the courage of Tamils, during the decades of cultural destruction and devastation in Sri Lanka, represents the highest aspirations of the human spirit.

Many decades later—dunes of emotions still dominate Global Tamils’ psyche somewhere between howling sadness and stunned silence.

Not even the passage of time has numbed how truly horrible it was.

It acknowledges the pain of displacement—the homes we lost, the families torn apart, the silence and stigma we sometimes carried—but it does not let those losses define us.

Instead, it sets dignity, resilience and achievement front and centre.

I believe that though past events are unchangeable, they can serve as important lessons in overcoming life’s struggles to strive for a better future.

While our collective story was unimaginable and unsettling, it was never without hope for humanity.

There should be many more books like ‘Uprooted’ to tell our collective story to the world from the rooftop.

What emerges in ‘Uprooted’ is not a single narrative of victimhood, but diverse experiences—stories of loss, yes, but also of creativity, dignity, ambition, contribution, and healing.

In giving space to survivors and strugglers, to the quiet workers and the outspoken leaders, Ana Pararajasingham paints a portrait of a diaspora that refused to be defined solely by trauma.

Instead, we see a community that rebuilt—with courage, hard work and compassion—and transformed roots lost into new anchors of identity, belonging and hope.

As a member of the Tamil diaspora, I found this book to be a powerful tribute and heartfelt homage to the Sri Lankan Tamil diaspora—a community that has endured unimaginable suffering yet emerged with extraordinary resilience and dignity.

Through thirty-four deeply personal narratives, Ana Pararajasingham has captured the remarkable journey of those who arrived on friendly shores with empty hands, as well as those born into exile, who carried only memories of their homeland, yet went on to build successful lives and nurture future generations.

These compelling stories serve as a reminder that the Tamil diaspora didn’t just survive—it thrived, while contributing to societies at large in Canada, the UK, Australia, and beyond, demonstrating that the human spirit can endure a lot. It is very resilient; it can be broken, but not easily.

For Tamils, this book acts as a mirror—authentic, truthful, and affirming.

For others, it’s an essential window into the experiences of a people whose stories of triumph in the lands of freedom and liberty merit to be heard with respect.

‘Uprooted’ by Ana Pararajasingham is a gift—to the Tamil diaspora, to those who lived through exile, and to future generations seeking to understand who we are and where we come from.

It is a testament to our pain and our power. It tugs at your heart, yes, but it also lifts you—with pride, empathy, and hope.

If you care about your identity, loss, belonging, and the audacious hope of rebuilding, read this book.

If you are not, it will remind you what resilience looks like—in the most human and beautiful ways.

My heartfelt gratitude to Ana Pararajasingham, who not only documented our remarkable journey, but also offered me a place within its story—a kindness that touched me.

‘Uprooted’ is concise, powerful, and full of heart, it is a must-read that honours the past and inspires the future.

Because, the best revenge, ladies and gentlemen, is by living well.

Uprooted is available on Amazon, and I encourage all who wish to understand these stories—told in the authentic voices of those who were uprooted—to purchase a copy.”
