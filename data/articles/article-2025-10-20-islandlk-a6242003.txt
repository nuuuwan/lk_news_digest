Aitken Spence partners with Sri Lanka Air Force on “Clean Today – Green Tomorrow”

Aitken Spence PLC has partnered with the Sri Lanka Air Force (SLAF) for the “Clean Today – Green Tomorrow” initiative, an environmental programme launched by the SLAF Seva Vanitha Unit to mark World Environment Day. The project aims to cultivate sustainability across Air Force camps and surrounding communities by facilitating education, exposure, and the practical application of environmentally responsible practices.

For Aitken Spence, sustainability lies at the heart of its identity. From Heritance Kandalama, globally recognised as a benchmark in eco-friendly hospitality, to its plantations that lead the way in sustainable agriculture, the Group has long championed environmental stewardship. Through this collaboration, Aitken Spence seeks to inspire a new generation of environmentally conscious communities by showcasing proven models of sustainability within its businesses. Participants gained both visible and behind-the-scenes exposure, complemented by expert insights that encouraged them to integrate sustainable practices within their camps as well as in their personal lives.

This partnership reinforces the Group’s alignment with several United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and national development priorities. The initiative supports Quality Education (SDG 4) by equipping learners with the knowledge and skills to advance sustainable development, while also promoting Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure (SDG 9) through the integration of innovative technologies in operational practices. It contributes to Responsible Consumption and Production (SDG 12) by encouraging waste reduction and resource efficiency, and advances Life on Land (SDG 15) through sustainable agricultural practices that preserve ecosystems and promote responsible land use. The collaboration itself exemplifies Partnerships for the Goals (SDG 17), highlighting the importance of collective efforts in driving sustainable progress.

As part of the partnership, the SLAF was hosted by Aitken Spence Hotels and Aitken Spence Plantations to gain first-hand exposure to sustainable operations. Participants visited Heritance Kandalama, where they observed pioneering initiatives in waste management, water and energy conservation, and environmentally responsible hospitality.
