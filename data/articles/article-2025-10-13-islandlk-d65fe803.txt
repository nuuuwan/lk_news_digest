Universities seen as ‘catalysts of real-world environmental change’

University of Colombo Vice Chancellor Professor Indika Karunathilake says universities must become catalysts for real-world environmental change through regional partnerships that bridge education, research, and policy.

Speaking to The Island Financial Review ahead of the Indo-Lanka Environmental Law Week, which begins tomorrow, Professor Karunathilake stressed that academic institutions have a responsibility to lead South Asia’s sustainability transformation.

“Environmental education must go beyond classrooms. It should inspire concrete actions that protect our environment and improve people’s lives, he said. “Our goal is to transform academic excellence into meaningful interventions that support a greener, more resilient future.”

He noted that the University of Colombo is committed to strengthening its sustainability agenda through initiatives that promote innovation in areas, such as, bioplastics, waste management and marine protection.

“These are not just research topics — they are national priorities, Professor Karunathilake said. “We want to see universities playing a central role in shaping Sri Lanka’s green economy.”

Professor Karunathilake emphasised that the university’s commitment to regional collaboration aligns with the goals of the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC).

“BIMSTEC provides an excellent platform to promote collective action on environmental sustainability, he said. “Our shared ocean, shared resources and shared challenges call for shared responsibility.”

He explained that the Indo-Lanka Environmental Law Week and the upcoming Policy Dialogue on Regional Environmental Cooperation, to be held on October 22 at the university’s Senate Hall, aim to produce a policy framework that advances environmental cooperation across the Bay of Bengal region.

“The environmental challenges faced by Sri Lanka and its neighbours — from marine pollution to climate impacts — are interconnected, he said. “We must work together through platforms like BIMSTEC to achieve regional solutions.”

Professor Karunathilake said the university’s approach combines academic rigour with practical implementation.

“Our students and faculty are not only studying environmental law — they are shaping the policies that will govern our future, he told The Island Financial Review. “This is the kind of regional academic collaboration that can redefine how we address sustainability challenges.”

He added that the University of Colombo aims to position itself as a hub for regional dialogue on environmental governance, promoting youth engagement, intergenerational equity and sustainable policymaking.

“We are proud to lead this initiative with our partners in India, he said. “By sharing expertise and building trust, we can strengthen regional cooperation and ensure that our actions today benefit future generations.”
