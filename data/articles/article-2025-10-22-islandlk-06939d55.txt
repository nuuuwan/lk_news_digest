Futurity (Pvt) Ltd, Sri Lanka’s first AI-native research studio, announced its strategic partnership with the Institution of Engineers, Sri Lanka (IESL) as the official AI Enablement Partner for Techno 2025, the country’s premier engineering and technology exhibition.

The collaboration was formalized at a signing ceremony attended by senior representatives from both organizations, including Eng. Kosala Kamburadeniya, IESL President Elect and Chairman of Techno 2025, and Eng. Neil Abeysekera, CEO of IESL, alongside Futurity’s leadership team.

As part of the agreement, Futurity will introduce a revolutionary AI-powered conversational assistant that is set to transform the way visitors experience Techno 2025. This cutting-edge application will allow visitors to navigate the exhibition seamlessly, access detailed information on exhibitors, and receive real-time guidance on event schedules and highlights. The assistant represents a fundamental shift in how exhibitions are organized and experienced, moving beyond static directories and brochures to deliver dynamic, intelligent, and interactive visitor support.

This collaboration underscores IESL’s commitment to positioning Techno 2025 as more than just an exhibition. But as a living demonstration of future-ready technology in action. By embedding AI into the visitor journey, the exhibition aims to set a new standard in engagement, efficiency, and knowledge-sharing within Sri Lanka’s innovation ecosystem.
