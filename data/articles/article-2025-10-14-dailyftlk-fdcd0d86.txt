Colombo Port posts Rs. 32 b profit YTD Aug. 2025

SLPA says will reinvest earnings to boost transshipment hub status

The Colombo Port has reported a post-tax profit of Rs. 32.2 billion for the first eight months of 2025, according to the Ministry of Transport, Highways, Ports and Civil Aviation.

This marks a sharp 71% rise from the Rs. 18.9 billion earned during the same period in 2024. The Ministry said the profit figure also exceeded the projected target of around Rs. 21 billion for the period.

The Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) attributed the improved financial performance to several factors, including higher operational efficiency, a 6% year-on-year growth in container handling, and the completion of major infrastructure works such as the Eastern Terminal and the Jaya Container Terminal expansion.

The SLPA said renewed terminal service agreements, capacity expansion, and tighter cost management also contributed to the profit surge. The Authority noted that the earnings will be reinvested in strategic projects aimed at strengthening Colomboâ€™s position as a regional transshipment hub.
