DIMO Healthcare partners with RAB to strengthen Radiology Education in Sri Lanka

In a landmark initiative aimed at empowering Sri Lanka’s healthcare professionals with advanced radiology knowledge, DIMO Healthcare, the healthcare arm of DIMO, recently collaborated with the non-governmental organization Radiology Across Borders (RAB) to host a series of educational sessions on RAB VITAL Ultrasound Scanning. This marks the first time such specialized RAB-led training sessions have been conducted in Sri Lanka.

The programme, which attracted over 80 local medical professionals, took place across four leading medical institutions — the Army Hospital, Hemas Hospital (Wattala), Durdans Hospital, and Lanka Hospitals. The sessions covered a range of vital topics including gynecological and obstetric basic scanning techniques, FAST scans in ICU or point-of-care environments, and deep vein thrombosis scanning.

Speaking on the initiative, Priyantha Dissanayake, Chief Operating Officer of DIMO Healthcare, said:”As a pioneer in the local radiology sphere and the approved partner of Siemens Healthineers, we believe it is our responsibility to bridge the knowledge gap between global medical advancements and local practice. By facilitating such training programmes, we aim to uplift healthcare standards across Sri Lanka and empower our medical professionals with the tools and expertise needed to ensure earlier disease detection and better patient care.”
