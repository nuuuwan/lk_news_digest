GDP data reaffirms persistent asymmetry of Sri Lanka’s provincial economy

Western Province maintains its dominant position, accounting for 42.4% of nominal GDP

The 2024 provincial GDP data reaffirms the profound and enduring structural asymmetry in Sri Lanka’s economic geography. The Western Province continues to function as the nation’s overwhelming economic core, while the second and third runners-up, the North Western and Central Provinces respectively, operate on a markedly different scale and sectoral foundation.

The Western Province maintains its dominant position, accounting for 42.4% of the country’s nominal GDP. This preeminence is rooted in its commanding role across the high-value Services and Industry sectors, where it contributes 44.5% and 47.6% of national output, respectively. Its economy is distinctively modern, with a scant 2.3% reliance on agriculture and over 98% of its output derived from industry and services. This concentration of finance, trade, administration, and manufacturing creates an unmatched gravitational pull for investment and talent.

In stark contrast, the combined economic share of the North Western (11.5%) and Central (10.7%) Provinces is just over half that of the Western Province alone. Their paths to relevance are fundamentally different. The North Western Province has solidified its role as the nation’s agricultural heartland, contributing a full 20.0% of national agricultural activity. It also holds a significant, though secondary, position in industry at 12.0%. Its internal economic composition is more balanced across sectors than the west, with a notable reliance on industry (29.1% of its own GDP) alongside agriculture.

The Central Province, meanwhile, presents a more services-oriented profile among the runners-up, contributing 10.7% to the national services total. It also holds important shares in agriculture (13.9%) and industry (9.6%). Internally, its economy mirrors the national structure most closely among major provinces, with services constituting about 63% of its output. This suggests a diversified regional economy centered on urban hubs like Kandy, but one that lacks the concentrated high-end service power of Colombo.

The comparative analysis reveals a clear hierarchy. The Western Province is the integrated, metropolitan driver of the modern economy. The North Western Province serves as a vital agro-industrial base, and the Central Province as a diversified regional center. Despite a noted increase in the combined share of the other provinces, the gap remains vast. The economic landscape is thus characterized not by convergence, but by a persistent and specialized asymmetry, where the runners-up support the national economy through different, but essential, sectoral strengths, all while operating in the long shadow of the western province.
