Agreement signed for Port City Colombo’s first Commercial Office Development

In Colombo, a new era of modern office infrastructure is set to begin at Port City Colombo with the development of Colombo Gateway Tower One, led by a consortium of investors spearheaded by Canary Wharf Holdings Pte Ltd based in Singapore. Canary Wharf is the development arm of Investment Advisory firm Platinum Advisors Pte Ltd, the project promoter of Colombo Gateway.

Canary Wharf consortium is set to develop a 34-storey tower, including 28 floors of premium office space covering a total office area of 28,000 sqm. The building will also include retail and leisure facilities, redefining Colombo’s business and lifestyle landscape.

Located at Plot 01-01-04, Port City Colombo, construction is slated to begin in May 2026 with an anticipated completion in June 2029. The tower will provide uninterrupted ocean views of the Marina and the city. It will feature state-of-the-art smart offices, high-quality amenities, and modern retail spaces, creating a dynamic environment that blends work, leisure, and commerce. The project aims to position Port City Colombo as a premier business hub in Sri Lanka and attract international and local enterprises alike.

Colombo Gateway Tower will help meet the growing demand for Grade-A office space within Port City Colombo, enabling registered Authorised Persons (APs) to transition from temporary premises outside the zone into a consolidated, premium workplace environment. This will support enhanced productivity, operational efficiency, and staff attraction and retention.
