Macbertan Ltd., was honoured with the National Gold Award in the medium manufacturing category at the prestigious Ceylon National Chamber of Industries (CNCI) Achiever Awards 2025. This award recognises Macbertan’s unwavering dedication to innovation and leadership in total quality management, service excellence, professionalism and sustainable growth within the Sri Lankan industrial landscape.

Founded in 1997 through a strategic alliance between McLarens Holdings Ltd., and Alliance Finance Company PLC, Macbertan has consistently set benchmark standards in Sri Lankan manufacturing. From pioneering the manufacture of expanded polyethylene foam and bubble sheets to developing advanced aluminium and plastic barrier laminate tubes, the company has relentlessly broadened its technological footprint. Macbertan’s brand promise, “Offering Enhanced Comfort & Safety,” lies at the core of its mission and is sustained with a skilled workforce of over 125 professionals and state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities. Its comprehensive product portfolio includes the flagship lines: McFOAM, McFOIL, McFOIL UltraWide, McWRAP ProtecPlus, and McLAMI TUBES. The CNCI Gold Award reinforces Macbertan’s leadership in manufacturing, but it is far more than a trophy, it is an affirmation of the company’s mission to deliver innovation, reliability, and local-manufactured excellence. Looking ahead, Macbertan will continue scaling its heat and sound insulation capabilities, expanding its packaging solutions footprint regionally, and forging deeper partnerships with clients and stakeholders who demand a professional service, par excellence. “As we celebrate this award, our commitment remains singular: to provide world-class solutions engineered in Sri Lanka, driven by professionalism, passion, and progress,” claims the senior management of Macbertan.
