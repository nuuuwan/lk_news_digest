Survivors seek $ 15 m in reparations for 1989 Valvettithurai massacre

Survivors and families of victims of the 1989 Valvettithurai massacre have submitted a detailed reparations claim to the Office for Reparations, seeking $ 15 million (about Rs. 4.5 billion) in compensation for mass killings and destruction carried out by the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) 36 years ago.

The claim, filed by the Citizens’ Committee of Valvettithurai, is the first to demand reparations for a mass atrocity committed by a foreign military on Sri Lankan soil. At least 66 civilians were killed and 34 others injured during a three-day assault from 2 to 4 August 1989. In addition, 123 houses and 43 shops were destroyed, while more than 250 homes were damaged.

“Although the perpetrators were foreign troops, these atrocities occurred within the Sovereign territory of Sri Lanka, and the victims were Sri Lankan citizens. Accordingly, the Government of Sri Lanka bears full responsibility to recognise, compensate, and restore justice to its own people,” Citizens’ Committee representative N. Anantharaj said in a letter to the Director General of the Office for Reparations.

A copy of the reparations claim and a report containing eyewitness testimonies were also handed over to President’s Counsel and former MP M.A. Sumanthiran.
