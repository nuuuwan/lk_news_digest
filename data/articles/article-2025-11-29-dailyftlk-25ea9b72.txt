Shanakiyan: disaster relief will stall without clear instructions, decisive action

Ilankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi MP Shanakiyan Rasamanickam yesterday urged the President to immediately issue a formal circular authorising officials to act during the ongoing severe weather crisis, warning that the absence of clear written instructions is delaying relief on the ground.

He made the remarks during a meeting convened by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake with leaders of opposition parties to discuss urgent measures in response to the deteriorating weather situation.

In a post on X after the meeting, Rasamanickam said district and divisional officials are reluctant to take decisions without an official directive, fearing administrative or legal repercussions. He noted that such hesitation directly affects people already in distress.

Rasamanickam called for immediate authority for District Secretaries and Divisional Secretaries to procure essential emergency supplies for affected families, and requested that the President issue a formal circular or gazette outlining implementation of the proposed measures.

The President had outlined a three-phase relief program covering cooked meals prepared by the military for those in shelters, dry rations for families staying with relatives, and cooked meals for those remaining in their homes. Rasamanickam said these plans cannot be delivered effectively without written instructions to guide officials.

Opposition MPs also highlighted the lack of disaster-response experience among some NPP parliamentarians, stressing that relief efforts must draw on experienced personnel and avoid government–opposition divides.

Rasamanickam further raised concerns about power outages in several areas, saying some communities have been without electricity for nearly two days, leaving them cut off from vital communication channels. He urged that the issue be resolved immediately.
