Health Minister visits LAUGFS Life Sciences’ state-of-the-art LVP pharmaceutical facility

Health and Mass Media Minister Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa recently undertook an observational visit to the state-of-the-art sterile pharmaceutical manufacturing facility of LAUGFS Life Sciences Ltd., located within the Board of Investment (BOI) Export Processing Zone, Koggala. This visit reflects the company’s commitment to strengthening Sri Lanka’s healthcare system through world-class local manufacturing.

Marking a significant milestone for the country’s healthcare industry, LAUGFS Life Sciences is advancing sterile infusion therapy production, reducing reliance on imports, delivering economic and clinical benefits, and positioning Sri Lanka as a regional hub for quality-driven pharmaceutical manufacturing through innovation, regulatory compliance, and private-sector investment.

The Health Minister was warmly welcomed by LAUGFS Holdings Ltd., Group Chief Executive Officer Dr. Ravi Edirisinghe, LAUGFS Life Sciences Ltd., Chief Executive Officer Dr. Rajiv Perera, Head of Quality Vipin Kumar, General Manager – Operations Ranjith Reddy, and General Manager – Head of Corporate Communications Wasaam Ismail, along with senior managers, quality specialists, and engineers of the facility.

During the visit, Dr. Jayatissa observed LAUGFS Life Sciences’ advanced sterile infusion production lines. The company is preparing to introduce Large Volume Parenterals (LVPs) using Euro Multiport systems and Form-Fill-Seal (FFS) technology. Euro Multiport ensures high-safety, multi-access containers for clinical use, while FFS automates forming, filling, and sealing in a sterile environment, minimising human intervention and contamination risks. These innovations aim to transform infusion therapy in Sri Lanka by reducing import dependence, ensuring a steady supply, and offering affordable solutions for both public and private healthcare sectors.

Dr. Jayatissa said: “This project is a commendable step forward for Sri Lanka’s healthcare sector. By investing in advanced pharmaceutical manufacturing, LAUGFS Life Sciences directly supports the Government’s vision of enhancing local production, saving valuable foreign exchange, and providing our citizens with reliable, world-class medical solutions. Public-private partnerships of this nature are critical to building a resilient healthcare system and ensuring patient safety and continuity of treatment.”

Dr. Edirisinghe said: “At LAUGFS, we believe in creating industries that bring long-term value to Sri Lanka. Through LAUGFS Life Sciences, we are making strategic investments in sterile pharmaceutical technologies that will not only benefit the local healthcare sector but also strengthen our position as a regional hub for pharmaceutical manufacturing.”

Dr. Perera said: “We are committed to ensuring that Sri Lanka has access to globally benchmarked infusion therapies through our advanced LVP production lines. With the integration of Euro Multiport and FFS technologies, we are setting new standards in quality, safety, and efficiency that will directly benefit both patients and healthcare providers.”
