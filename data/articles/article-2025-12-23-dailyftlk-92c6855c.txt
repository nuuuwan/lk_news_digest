Cargills contributes Rs. 100 m to ’Rebuilding Sri Lanka’ Fund

The Government’s Rebuilding Sri Lanka National Fund has continued to receive support from both local and international organisations as part of the national effort to assist disaster recovery. In support of this initiative, the Cargills Group has made a contribution of Rs. 100 million to the Rebuilding Sri Lanka National Fund.

The contribution was formally handed over to the Secretary to the President Dr. Nandika Sanath Kumanayake, by Cargills Group Managing Director Imtiaz Abdul Wahid, in the presence of Cargills Group Executive Director Dilantha Jayawardhana.

Alongside this contribution, Cargills has continued its on-ground relief efforts by providing essential food supplies and dry rations valued at over Rs. 45 million to affected areas across the country, reaching more than 20,000 families.

Beyond immediate relief, Cargills is working closely with agricultural farmers, distributors, and small local businesses impacted by the recent disaster, helping them get back on their feet and resume their livelihoods as they rebuild their businesses.
