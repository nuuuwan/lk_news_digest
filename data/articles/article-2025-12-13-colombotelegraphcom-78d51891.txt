From Sermons To Bargains: What The New US National Security Strategy Means For Sri Lanka

The release of the new United States National Security Strategy (NSS) marks a decisive shift in how Washington intends to navigate an increasingly fragmented world. For decades, US strategies—whether Republican or Democratic—tended to stress global leadership, universal values, and expansive notions of national interest. The new NSS departs from that template. It narrows America’s core interests, asserts sovereignty more forcefully, and adopts a transactional, balance-of-power lens. It also signals a reorientation of American attention towards challenges in its own hemisphere while maintaining sharp competition with China in Asia.

For Sri Lanka, these changes carry both risks and opportunities. Situated at the heart of the Indian Ocean sea lanes but caught between competing global priorities, Colombo must read this document not as an academic exercise but as an early indication of how US policy will unfold over the next few years. In many ways, the NSS functions as a mirror: it compels Sri Lanka to clarify its own strategic objectives, articulate coherent policies, and strengthen its capacity for balanced diplomacy in a more demanding international environment.

A Narrower Map: Where Sri Lanka Fits in the New US Strategic Priorities

The NSS makes one point abundantly clear: Washington no longer claims to lead in every region or address every global problem. Instead, it outlines tightly defined interests—border security, supply-chain resilience, industrial revival, great-power competition with China, and reversing foreign influence in the Western Hemisphere. The document also introduces what commentators have called a “Trump Corollary” to the Monroe Doctrine, reaffirming US primacy in its neighbourhood and directing more resources to counter-migration, narcotics, and Chinese penetration in Latin America.

This recalibration inevitably squeezes the attention available for smaller states in distant theatres such as the Indian Ocean. That does not render Sri Lanka irrelevant; rather, it shifts how relevance is interpreted. Sri Lanka’s importance to Washington will be assessed primarily through three lenses: maritime geography, the China factor, and India’s rise. In a world where the US focuses more narrowly on matters that directly affect its economic or strategic resilience, Colombo must demonstrate clear added value—whether in maritime cooperation, supply-chain diversification, counter-narcotics activities, or maintaining stability in the Indian Ocean Region.

China, Infrastructure Politics, and the Fear of Becoming a ‘Proxy Platform’

A central theme in the NSS is the long-term economic and technological rivalry with China. Although the US avoids Cold War terminology, the strategy openly warns that Beijing increasingly relies on low- and middle-income countries as intermediary platforms for export diversification and influence-building. This is where Sri Lanka perhaps enters the picture.

As a country hosting major Chinese infrastructure projects—including the Hambantota Port and parts of Colombo Port—and as a crucial node close to the Strait of Hormuz and Malacca, Sri Lanka is likely to be viewed through the prism of China’s expanding economic footprint. Washington’s concern is less about ideological alignment and more about strategic permeability: whether Chinese-built infrastructure could increase Beijing’s leverage in South Asian waters, undermine allied supply chains, or facilitate dual-use access in crisis scenarios.

For Colombo, the challenge is to avoid appearing as a passive conduit for Chinese interests while still securing much-needed investment. That requires transparent port governance, credible debt restructuring pathways, regulatory clarity, and a willingness to diversify economic partnerships. The new NSS suggests that US and allied investments may flow more readily if countries demonstrate robust safeguards against coercive or opaque foreign influence. In other words, the US is not asking Sri Lanka to choose sides; it is asking for predictability, transparency, and strategic reassurance.

Another defining feature of the strategy is its embrace of balance-of-power logic. The NSS rejects the idea that the US should dominate every region; instead, it aims to prevent any other power from doing so. In the Indo-Pacific, this translates into clear support for India’s rise as a counterweight to China, and a commitment to deepening defence, technological, and economic partnerships with New Delhi.

For Sri Lanka, this reinforces a long-standing reality: India will remain the primary security provider in the Indian Ocean, and major powers—including the US—will expect Colombo’s strategic choices to be consistent with India’s core interests. This does not mean subordination, but it does mean that the margin for manoeuvre is narrower when decisions appear to challenge India’s security sensitivities.

In the coming years, Washington is likely to engage Sri Lanka through India-centred frameworks such as the Colombo Security Conclave, Indo-Pacific maritime initiatives, and regional economic platforms. This requires Colombo to strengthen trust with New Delhi—whether through intelligence-sharing, counter-narcotics cooperation, or transparent communication regarding port access and foreign military activities. At the same time, Sri Lanka must maintain room to engage China, Japan, the Gulf, the EU, and ASEAN in line with its national interest, practising what might be called disciplined multi-alignment.

One of the most noticeable shifts in the new NSS is its reduced emphasis on democracy promotion and its skepticism towards “transnational organisations” seen as eroding sovereignty. Compared to the Biden-era strategy, the new approach is far less inclined to frame foreign policy around values or international norms.

For Sri Lanka, this may translate into slightly reduced US-led pressure on human rights and accountability issues in multilateral fora. Nevertheless, Washington will not completely withdraw from these debates; domestic constituencies and bipartisan concerns still give human rights a place in US foreign policy. The difference is that human rights may no longer dominate the bilateral agenda or be presented as an overriding condition for cooperation.

But there is a counterpoint: fewer sermons do not mean fewer expectations. The new NSS is unapologetically transactional. It expects partners to contribute tangibly to US strategic goals—whether that means maritime security cooperation, cracking down on narcotics flows, or aligning on supply chains and critical minerals. Assistance, access, and high-level engagement may increasingly depend on the mutual benefits each side can demonstrate, rather than on shared values or historical goodwill.

Economic Diplomacy Reimagined: The Rise of Friend-Shoring and Industrial Policy

Economic security lies at the heart of the new strategy. The NSS promises to re-industrialise the United States, rebuild supply chains, protect critical minerals, and align like-minded countries against predatory trade practices. For Sri Lanka, this shift can be turned into opportunity—if approached with clarity and reform.

The country’s geographic advantage, port infrastructure, and developing logistics ecosystem make it a natural candidate for friend-shoring in selected sectors. Apparel, information technology, shipping services, digital back-office operations, and even mineral-based inputs such as graphite could attract US and allied interest if Sri Lanka strengthens its regulatory environment. Improving contract enforcement, reducing corruption vulnerabilities, and ensuring transparent procurement will be critical.

Moreover, Sri Lanka’s economic crisis has made diversification essential. Competing for investment within US-led or US-friendly supply-chain networks could help the country move beyond traditional export markets and reduce overreliance on any single major power. In this respect, the NSS opens a window—but Sri Lanka must position itself deliberately to seize it.

A Lesson for Colombo: Time to Finalise Sri Lanka’s Own National Security Strategy

The most important takeaway from the new US NSS may not be about the United States at all. It is about Sri Lanka. For years, policymakers and experts have emphasised the need for Sri Lanka to articulate its own National Security Strategy—one that integrates economic security, maritime priorities, foreign policy, cyber threats, internal stability, and disaster resilience. Without such a strategy, Sri Lanka is forced into a reactive posture, interpreting global developments without a defined framework of national priorities.

A Sri Lankan NSS would enable Colombo to negotiate from a position of clarity, avoid ad hoc decision-making, and ensure consistency across governments. It would help Sri Lanka respond to major-power shifts—whether those driven by the US, China, India, or the Gulf—with coherence instead of improvisation.

The new US NSS, with its sharper edges and more transactional tone, underscores the urgency of this task.

The international system entering 2025 is not one of gentle transitions but of intensified competition, fragmented alliances, and redefined national interests. The new US National Security Strategy does not dilute this reality; it codifies it. For Sri Lanka, the implications are neither entirely positive nor entirely negative. They are conditional—depending on how Colombo positions itself, reforms its economy, communicates its strategic choices, and strengthens ties with key partners, especially India and the United States.

Ultimately, the shift from global sermons to strategic bargains means that Sri Lanka must be more agile, more coherent, and more confident in safeguarding its interests. Those who adapt quickly to the new geopolitical vocabulary—and articulate their own—will thrive. Those who cling to ambiguous postures risk being shaped by external strategies instead of shaping their own destiny.
