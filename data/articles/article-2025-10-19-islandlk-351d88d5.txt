Casons Rent a Car introduces Sri Lanka’s first fleet of eco-friendly vehicles

For the first time in Sri Lanka, Casons Rent a Car, a leading family-run car rental company, has introduced a fleet of eco-friendly green vehicles to local roads.

Founder and Chairman M.C. Zakir Ahamed said the company has acquired a new range of vehicles designed to minimise environmental impact and reduce carbon emissions. The fleet comprises fully electric vehicles (EVs) with zero tailpipe emissions, as well as hybrid and clean diesel models that offer improved fuel efficiency.

Ahamed noted that customer demand for electric vehicles has been rising steadily, as they are cheaper to operate, environmentally sustainable, and help reduce both air and noise pollution.

“We aim to make green mobility affordable by offering special rental rates for our eco-friendly vehicles.”

Known for its high standards of customer service and satisfaction, Casons Rent a Car expanded its operations in 2017 to the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) with the opening of a modern travel counter at the arrival terminal. Ahamed also revealed that Casons has added a fleet of Jaicoo electric cars to its lineup, which will be available both at its head office in Gothami Road, Rajagiriya, and Airport counter at BIA.

Casons, which will be celebrating its 38th anniversary on November 5, has grown into one of the country’s most trusted car rental providers. The company says it operates the largest vehicle fleet in Sri Lanka’s car rental industry and continues to lead the way in introducing innovative and sustainable mobility solutions.
