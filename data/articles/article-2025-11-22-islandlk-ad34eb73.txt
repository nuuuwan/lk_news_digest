Budget 2026: The Emperor’s new clothes

There’s an old saying in politics: it’s easier to criticize from the opposition benches than to govern from the cabinet. President Anura Kumara Dissanayake’s 2025 & 2026 budget presentations have proven this adage with stunning, almost theatrical precision. What we witnessed was not merely disappointing policy documents, they were masterclass in political amateurism, economic illiteracy, and brazen historical revisionism that should alarm every serious observer of Sri Lankan governance.

Let’s begin with the most glaring intellectual fraud: AKD’s audacious attempt to claim credit for economic stabilization he actively sabotaged. As an opposition politician, he was the loudest voice denouncing the IMF program as a “sellout of national sovereignty” and a “neo-colonial agreement.” He mobilized protests, inflamed public anger, and positioned himself as he stood firmly against the very cost-cutting, revenue focused and foreign reserves building policies that later helped save Sri Lanka from complete economic collapse.

Now, as President, he speaks solemnly of guiding “complex negotiations” to completion, as if he were the architect rather than the arsonist. This isn’t political evolution; it’s political amnesia of the most cynical variety. The IMF Extended Fund Facility that stabilized our foreign reserves, the debt standstill that preserved our scant remaining dollars, the painful tax reforms that rebuilt government revenue, every single pillar of our current stability was constructed by the Wickremesinghe administration while AKD threw rhetorical Molotov cocktails from the sidelines.

To now claim stewardship of this recovery is like a man who spent years vandalizing a bridge suddenly demanding applause for finally allowing people to cross it. It reveals something far more troubling than ordinary political opportunism, it suggests a leader fundamentally disconnected from the consequences of his own words and actions.

When the budget speech turned to infrastructure, it delivered one of its most puzzling moments, full of contradictions that left many scratching their heads. Here was a man whose political party built its reputation on obstructing every major development project in recent memory, filing fundamental rights cases against the Central Expressway, leading protests against Port City, framing highways as “corrupt, debt-trapping ventures that served only the elite to transport Embul Thiyal” (of course corruption not only on highways but also on Nelum kuluna, Mattala airport, Mahinda Rajapaksa International Cricket Stadium Weerawila, without matches, etc., in previous governments by SLPP and UNP as well, should be handled separately), now waxing poetic about connectivity and the economic potential of national infrastructure.

This is not merely hypocrisy; it’s historical theft. The JVP’s legacy on infrastructure is one of delay, increased costs, and mindless obstructionism dressed up as environmental concern or anti-corruption zeal. Engineers and project managers spent more time in courtrooms defending legitimate projects than they did on construction sites, thanks to the very party AKD led.

Now he stands before us as a modernizer? A builder? He’s neither. He’s a squatter who moved into a completed house and is pointing at the foundation claiming he mixed the cement. The sheer audacity would be impressive if it weren’t so insulting to the intelligence of anyone with a functional memory.

Beyond the historical revisionism, the actual policy content of the budget reveals a disturbing lack of economic sophistication. The government inherited a clear, IMF-mandated path: achieve a primary surplus of 2.3% of GDP, broaden the tax base, control expenditure, and reform loss-making state enterprises. These aren’t suggestions, their contractual obligations with international creditors.

The budget “appears to be betting on increased revenue from economic growth to fill the gap, a risky strategy that presumes growth will be robust and immediate. That’s not a plan, it’s magical thinking, as he claimed it by himself. These kinds of ideas don’t rescue countries from debt; they push them further in. The IMF demanded “better-targeted social safety nets to reduce fiscal drains,” and instead we got expanded, poorly targeted handouts that directly contradict the program’s core philosophy.

AKD wants the credit for stability without enduring the pain of maintaining it. He wants to be seen as generous to the people while locked into tight spending rules. The result is a budget that satisfies neither the IMF’s demands nor the public’s genuine needs, the worst of both worlds.

The budget’s treatment of SOE reform? Vague references to “restructuring” and finding “strategic partners” with no concrete timelines, no financial targets, no clear frameworks, and critically, no mention of depoliticizing board appointments. This is the language of someone who knows what he should do but lacks the spine to do it.

The budget’s approach to taxation reveals the same pattern of intellectual incoherence. While making minor adjustments to tax brackets, the government introduced a “complex array of tax holidays and concessions for specific sectors like technology, agriculture, and exports.” This is precisely backwards.

The IMF program, which AKD now claims to champion, requires simplification and broadening of the tax base. Instead, we ended up with a flood of special exemptions that “creates a complex and non-neutral tax system” that “distorts investment decisions, opens avenues for lobbying and corruption, and ultimately narrows the tax base, the exact opposite of what the IMF program requires.”

This isn’t sophisticated economic policy, it’s the work of someone confusing activity with achievement, someone who thinks complexity equals competence. Any first-year economics student understands that tax neutrality and simplicity are foundations of good policy. But AKD’s budget reads like it was designed by a committee trying to please every special interest that lobbied them.

And then there’s the immediate retreat from core campaign promises. AKD rode to power partly on the pledge to “remove the oppressive VAT on essential items” like medicines, educational materials, and food imports. This was his answer to the public’s pain, his differentiation from the “neoliberal” policies he condemned.

The reality? “Minor, symbolic VAT exemptions for a very narrow list of specific goods” while the budget speech emphasized the “critical need to preserve government revenue streams to maintain the primary surplus.” In other words, once in power, the constraints of the IMF program, that program he called neo-colonial, became gospel. The promise-maker became the promise-breaker within months.

This isn’t pragmatism; it’s a bait-and-switch. The public was sold one vision and delivered another, with barely an acknowledgment of the pivot. It demonstrates what happens when populist rhetoric meets fiscal reality: rhetoric dies, but the trust also dies with it.

For a nation that recently defaulted on its debt, transparency should be the watchword of every budget presentation. International creditors and domestic investors alike need granular detail on debt restructuring progress, contingent liabilities from SOEs, and the government’s medium-term fiscal strategy.

Instead, we got “a high-level overview of debt obligations” that “lacked granular detail on the progress of restructuring negotiations with commercial and bilateral creditors beyond China.” For someone claiming to be steering the ship, AKD seems remarkably uninterested in showing us the map. This opacity “leaves room for speculation and undermines the market confidence the budget seeks to foster.”

In a properly managed economy, budgets are opportunities to build confidence through disclosure. In AKD’s amateur production, the budget raises more questions than it answers, suggesting either incompetence in communication or deliberate obfuscation, neither of which inspires confidence

The NPP government’s procurement of 1,775 brand-new double cab pickup trucks isn’t merely fiscal recklessness; it’s a textbook example of Marxist-Leninist party machinery consolidation masquerading as administrative reform. What we’re witnessing is the JVP’s instinctive reversion to authoritarian patterns of control, patronage distribution, and ideological uniformity that defined every failed socialist experiment of the 20th century.

Remember the old Soviet joke? Citizens could have any car they wanted, as long as it was a Lada! The JVP government has imported this mentality wholesale. By mandating identical, government-issued vehicles for all representatives, they’re imposing uniformity that has nothing to do with efficiency and everything to do with control.

This isn’t about transportation logistics. It’s about establishing a visible, material symbol of party dominance, a fleet of identical vehicles, all bearing government plates, all procured through party-controlled processes, all distributed as rewards for political loyalty. In the socialist playbook, such standardization serves dual purposes: it demonstrates state power over individual choice while creating dependency chains that bind recipients to the regime.

The timing exposes the real motive. With local government bodies now dominated by NPP/JVP cadres following recent electoral victories, this massive procurement functions as the material foundation for party entrenchment. These 1,775 vehicles aren’t transportation solutions, they’re instruments of political consolidation, distributed to party cadres across the country, binding them through material dependence on the central apparatus.

This is classic Leninist democratic centralism adapted for 21st-century Sri Lanka: concentrate resources at party headquarters, distribute them as patronage, demand loyalty in return. The double cabs become party property in all but name, with recipients understanding that continued access depends on continued allegiance.

The procurement process itself reads like a manual on how to fake competition while ensuring predetermined outcomes. The standard 42-day National Competitive Bidding window compressed to 12 days. Eligibility criteria so specific they could name the beneficiaries outright: 10 years of experience, 1,000 vehicles delivered, 10 service centers, Rs. 10 billion turnover, Rs. 50 million security deposit. This isn’t incompetence, it’s competent corruption. The JVP spent decades in opposition studying how power works. Now, they’re applying those lessons with the efficiency of apparatchiks who know exactly what they’re doing. The tender was designed not to find the best value for taxpayers but to channel public money to connected entities while maintaining plausible deniability.

When confronted, the government deploys classic bureaucratic deflection: the Ministry of Public Security claims ignorance, the Treasury points elsewhere, officials become unreachable. This shell game is straight from the authoritarian playbook, diffuse responsibility so thoroughly that accountability becomes impossible.

The economy is deliberately destructive. Under the permit system, government bore only duty exemption costs, essentially foregone revenue. MPs purchased, maintained, insured, and fueled their vehicles. Personal ownership created natural incentives for care and cost-consciousness.

The new system socializes every cost: purchase, maintenance, insurance, fuel, depreciation, bureaucratic overhead, estimated at Rs. 2-3 billion annually beyond the initial Rs. 12.5 billion. This isn’t just wasteful; it’s ideologically driven waste. JVP’s Marxist DNA recoils from private ownership and individual autonomy. It is better to waste billions on centralized control than allow the “bourgeois” efficiency of personal responsibility.

The government’s claim that MPs “exploited” permits by selling them is intellectually fraudulent. If an MP monetized their permit and used alternative transport, they saved taxpayers maintenance and fuel costs. The permit represented the government’s contribution, what MPs did with it was their choice. That’s called individual autonomy, and to Marxists, it’s a bug, not a feature.

Now, taxpayers fund everything while MPs enjoy government transport. We’ve moved from potential individual benefit to guaranteed collective loss. This is socialism in practice: equal distribution of scarcity, inefficiency, and dependence.

The most chilling aspect isn’t financial, it’s philosophical. Democratic pluralism respects that a representative from mountainous terrain might need different transport than one from Colombo. That an MP might prefer a fuel-efficient hybrid over a diesel guzzler. These choices reflect democratic diversity and individual judgment.

The JVP’s “one vehicle fits all” mandate reveals their authoritarian core. Uniformity. Conformity. Central control. When the state dictates even the vehicle you must drive, it signals a broader tendency toward control extending far beyond logistics into political culture itself. This is the Marxist impulse toward totality, the belief that rational planning from the center produces better outcomes than distributed individual choices. Every socialist regime has started here: standardizing the visible, the material, the daily interactions of life, conditioning citizens to accept state dictation as normal.

Why exactly 1,775 vehicles? The government’s vague references to “government institutions” don’t withstand scrutiny. Parliament has 225 members. Provincial councils and local bodies add more, but 1,775?

The number makes sense only as party machinery consolidation. With NPP/JVP now controlling local government, these vehicles flow to party cadres at every level, not just elected officials but party operatives, provincial organizers, local committee members.

This is building a party state where material resources flow through party channels, creating dependency networks that strengthen central control. This is textbook Leninist organization: a vanguard party maintaining discipline through material distribution, ensuring loyalty through access to state resources. The double cabs aren’t transportation; they’re the physical infrastructure of single-party dominance.

Sri Lanka faces resumed debt repayments in 2028 requiring USD 13 billion in foreign reserves. The rupee crisis persists. Revenue surges from import duties are temporary bubbles. In this context, wasting Rs. 12,500+ million on unnecessary vehicles while committing billions more in recurring costs is fiscal suicide.

But for the JVP, ideology trumps economics. Building party infrastructure, demonstrating state power, imposing uniformity, these matter more than fiscal responsibility. This is the socialist calculation: political consolidation now, regardless of economic consequences later.

The people who voted for change deserve better than a fleet of pickup trucks purchased through rigged tenders, financed by their taxes, distributed as party favors. They deserve a government that respects democratic norms, fiscal responsibility, and the principle that public resources belong to the public, not to party machinery.

If this procurement proceeds, it confirms that Sri Lanka has exchanged one corrupt system for another, this time with Marxist characteristics. The double cabs will roll through our streets as mobile monuments to authoritarian creep, fiscal irresponsibility, and the JVP’s transformation from revolutionary opposition to just another party of power, patronage, and control.

That road leads only to ruin, fiscal, political, and moral. The question is whether Sri Lankans will recognize the danger before the consolidation becomes irreversible.

The 2026 budget is not a document of reform, it’s a document of retreat disguised as pragmatism, of opportunism masquerading as statesmanship. It represents the collision between campaign fantasy and governing reality, and in that collision, what’s been destroyed is not just a set of promises but the credibility of a leader who appears to believe his own revisionist history.

Economic policy isn’t performance art. The budget reveals a leader out of his depth, surrounded by the very institutions and agreements he spent years undermining, now desperately trying to claim credit for their success while simultaneously diluting their effectiveness with populist gestures.

The greatest danger isn’t that this budget is bad, though it is. The greatest danger is that it reveals a governing philosophy built entirely on political expedience rather than economic principle. When a leader’s positions are infinitely flexible, when his rhetoric today contradicts his rhetoric yesterday without acknowledgment, when claiming credit matters more than creating value, the nation is left confused/lost.

Sri Lanka deserves better than a chameleon in the Finance Ministry. We deserve leaders who remember their own words, who acknowledge the foundations they inherited, and who have the courage to make unpopular decisions when necessary, rather than wrapping retreat in the language of reform.

The emperor’s new budget, like the Emperor’s new clothes, is a fiction sustained only by our collective willingness to pretend we don’t see the naked truth.
