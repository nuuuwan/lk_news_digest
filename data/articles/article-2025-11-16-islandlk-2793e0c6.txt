Agro Harvest Cultivation secures major Dubai order

Agro Harvest Cultivation (Pvt) Ltd has become the first Sri Lankan company to export vermicompost fertilizer, securing a 500-ton order from the State of Dubai.

The company’s new production facility in Matale, equipped with modern machinery, produces organic fertilizer compliant with international standards. This breakthrough has also attracted strong interest from several European countries, with negotiations underway to expand exports to China.

The company has obtained all necessary approvals from relevant national authorities for its international shipments.

Nalaka Silva, a senior representative of Agro Harvest Cultivation, said, “Many countries have fully transitioned to organic agriculture, and even India now produces over 50% of its crops using organic fertilizers. In this context, we are proud to have successfully implemented a process which provides a wide range of products and services aimed at supporting both local and international agricultural development.
