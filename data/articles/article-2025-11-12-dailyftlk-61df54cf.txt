Pakistan accuses India of orchestrating suicide bombing in Islamabad, 12 killed

Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif accused India of orchestrating the suicide bombing outside an Islamabad court that killed 12 people, as well as Monday’s attack on a cadet college in Wana near the Afghan border.

Citing the Associated Press of Pakistan, Sharif alleged that “Indian-sponsored terrorist proxies” were behind both incidents, describing them as part of India’s “State-sponsored terrorism” to destabilise Pakistan.

A suicide bomber detonated explosives outside a district court in Islamabad on Tuesday, killing 12 people and injuring 27. The blast occurred near a police car during a busy period, causing widespread chaos.

Witnesses reported scenes of panic as the explosion, heard miles away, struck an area crowded with visitors attending court hearings.

A breakaway faction of the Pakistani Taliban, the Jamaat-ul-Ahrar group, claimed responsibility for the attack.
