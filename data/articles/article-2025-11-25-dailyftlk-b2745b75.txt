Celebrating two decades of innovation, Cenmetrix has emerged as a pioneer and trusted name in Sri Lanka’s digital identity and access management landscape—a company whose technologies continue to redefine how organisations manage identity, security, and efficiency.

Over the past 20 years, Cenmetrix has successfully completed over 10,000 deployments and built long-term partnerships with enterprises across South Asia and beyond—from manufacturing to government and hospitality.

From the outset, Cenmetrix has differentiated itself by prioritising reliability and service quality over short-term sales. This approach has cultivated a loyal customer base and positioned the company as a trusted technology enabler across both private and public sectors.

Cenmetrix Founding Director Farhard Hussain said: “We founded Cenmetrix on a simple belief—technology should grow with our clients. Our success lies not in selling products, but in understanding how our solutions can integrate seamlessly into their operations to deliver measurable value.”

At a time when biometric technology was still emerging globally, Cenmetrix became one of Sri Lanka’s first companies to specialise in biometric identification. Though adoption was initially slow, its persistence paid off as industries particularly in manufacturing and security began embracing biometrics for attendance, payroll, and access control. With strong in-house R&D and partnerships with global leaders such as Suprema, Nedap, HID, NXP, and Zebra Technologies, Cenmetrix delivers world-class yet locally relevant solutions across diverse industries.

Cenmetrix’s strength lies in its seamless integration of hardware and software, delivering intelligent solutions that streamline administration and drive operational efficiency. Today, its systems power some of Sri Lanka’s most prominent institutions, including the Defence Ministry, MAS Group, Dialog, and the Parliament of Sri Lanka. The company’s expertise has also extended beyond local borders through key international projects such as the Maldives International Airport, Yaquby Distribution in Bahrain, Easy Secure in the Netherlands, and the U.S. Air Force base in South Korea—underscoring Cenmetrix’s growing global footprint in smart identity and access technology.

Over the years, Cenmetrix has evolved from manual, relationship-driven processes to fully digitised client support systems, without losing its human touch. Preventive maintenance, digital feedback loops, and proactive service models have become integral to its customer experience strategy.

Employee retention has also played a key role in the company’s stability, with nearly half its workforce having been with Cenmetrix for over a decade, a testament to its strong internal culture and shared vision.

Following its success in Sri Lanka, Cenmetrix has expanded operations to Singapore and the United States, and is now entering markets across Asia-Pacific, the Middle East, and Africa. The company adopts a partnership-driven approach, collaborating with regional firms to tailor solutions for local market needs while leveraging Cenmetrix’s end-to-end technical expertise.

Cenmetrix Founding Director Ziyam Kamil said: “Our global journey is rooted in the same principles that built our success at home, trust, integration and innovation. We believe in empowering partners and clients through technology that’s seamless, secure, and future-ready.”

Looking ahead, Cenmetrix is embedding artificial intelligence (AI), analytics, and automation into its platforms to help organisations make faster, data-driven decisions. The company continues to invest in R&D, global collaborations, and partner enablement to stay ahead of evolving client needs and emerging technologies.

As it looks toward the future, Cenmetrix remains committed to its founding vision: to build trust through quality, evolve through innovation, and strengthen relationships through technology. As it enters its third decade, Cenmetrix remains focused on scaling globally while staying true to its core promise—to innovate with integrity, empower through technology, and build trust in every identity.
