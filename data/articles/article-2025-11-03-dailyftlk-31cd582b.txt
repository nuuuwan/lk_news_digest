President calls on Maha Sangha to back national anti-drug drive

President Anura Kumara Disanayake yesterday called on religious leaders, particularly the Maha Sangha, to support the Government’s nationwide initiative to eliminate the drug menace from Sri Lanka.

Speaking at an event marking the 150th anniversary of the Peliyagoda Vidyalankara Pirivena, held at the Vidyalankara International Buddhist Conference Hall, the President said the campaign’s success depended on collective action from all communities, regardless of religion, ethnicity, or political belief.

“The spread of drugs has reached unimaginable levels,” he said. “Differences in political ideology cannot stand in the way of confronting this problem. We must all come together to bring it to an end.”

He underscored the historic connection between the temple and the village, describing the Buddhist monk’s role as central to rebuilding social values.

“Whenever the country faced a crisis, the Maha Sangha stepped forward for the nation and the people. That guidance is needed again. To rebuild our country, we need monks who once went from house to house and village to village to guide the people,” he said, urging their active participation in the anti-drug initiative.

The ceremony was attended by members of the Maha Sangha, former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa, Ministers, former Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena, and other political and religious representatives.
