LTL Transformers Ltd., has been honoured with the Global Performance Excellence Award (GPEA) under the World-Class Category, presented by the Asia Pacific Quality Organisation (APQO), the region’s highest recognition for organisational excellence.

The prestigious award was presented during the 30th APQO International Conference, held from 15 to 16 October, at the Beijing International Convention Center, Beijing, China. The event brought together leading organisations from across the Asia-Pacific region, recognising outstanding achievements in quality management and business excellence.

LTL is the nation’s premier transformer manufacturer, a subsidiary of LTL Holdings Ltd. (formally known as Lanka Transformers Ltd.)

The APQO is a non-profit body that promotes quality improvement and business excellence across the Asia-Pacific region by uniting national quality institutions and leading organisations. Its flagship recognition, the Global Performance Excellence Award (GPEA), is the region’s only formal international award for performance excellence. Based on global models like the Baldrige and EFQM frameworks, the GPEA evaluates organisations across seven areas: Leadership, Strategic Planning, Customer Focus, Knowledge Management, Workforce, Operations, and Business Results.

The World-Class Award, the highest category of the GPEA, honours organisations that exhibit exceptional performance excellence, strong commitment to quality, and continuous improvement. It recognises effective management, proven results, and a deep understanding of excellence principles, with innovation and improvement systematically implemented across the organisation.

This global distinction places LTL Transformers among an elite group of international industry leaders, reaffirming Sri Lanka’s capability to compete at the highest global standards.
