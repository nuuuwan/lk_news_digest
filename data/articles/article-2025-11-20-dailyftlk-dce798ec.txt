Govt. updates driving licence levy for foreigners and foreign licence-holders

The Transport Ministry has announced revisions to the Motor Traffic Act, issuing Gazette No. 2463/04 on 17 November to update fees under the Motor Traffic (Driving Licence Levy) Regulations of 2022.

Under the new schedule, Sri Lankans holding a foreign driving licence will be required to pay Rs. 30,000 to obtain a local licence. Non-citizens seeking to secure a Sri Lankan licence based on one issued overseas will be charged Rs. 60,000.

The regulations also introduce a series of additional charges ranging from Rs. 15,000 to Rs. 45,000 for renewals, duplicates, and temporary licences for non-citizens and short-term visitors, with the exact fee depending on the type and duration of the licence.

The Ministry says the adjustments reflect current policy requirements and fee structures and take effect from the date of the Gazette. While some observers have raised concerns about the higher cost for foreign licence-holders and tourists, others view the revisions as a move towards more consistent regulation and improved revenue administration.
