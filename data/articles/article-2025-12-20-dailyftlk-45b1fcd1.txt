Sri Lanka marks 70 Years of UN Membership in New York

The Permanent Mission of Sri Lanka to the United Nations in New York, under the leadership of Sri Lanka’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations Jayantha Jayasuriya, marked the 70th anniversary of Sri Lanka’s membership in the United Nations through a series of activities, underscoring the country’s longstanding commitment to international cooperation, principled multilateralism, and inclusive global engagement.

On 11 December, Sri Lanka joined fifteen other Member States—Albania, Austria, Bulgaria, Cambodia, Finland, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Jordan, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Libya, Nepal, Portugal, Romania, and Spain—at United Nations Headquarters to mark a shared milestone. The high-level discussion brought together Ambassadors of these sixteen States and a panel of political analysts to reflect on achievements, challenges, and the future of the multilateral system. The event was broadcast on UN Live WebTV.

Speaking at the event, Ambassador Jayasuriya said: “As we celebrate the 80th anniversary of the United Nations this year, we celebrate its achievements and its indispensable role in the multilateral system. But anniversaries are also moments for reflection. Together, we must strengthen and improve this intergovernmental organisation for the future without compromising its core objectives or guiding principles, so that we may continue to work towards a fairer, more just, and prosperous global order.”

During the joint commemoration, the sixteen Ambassadors unveiled a special commemorative stamp symbolising unity, cooperation, and the equal place of each Member State within the United Nations.

Earlier in the year, during UN Open Source Week in June 2025, the Mission partnered with the Permanent Mission of Italy to the UN and Wiki Media to host an “Edit-A-Thon” highlighting the importance of open and reliable information in preserving the institutional memory of the UN. Ambassador Jayasuriya noted, “This event is a chance to strengthen the UN’s historical record, empower young people, and centre diverse perspectives, including voices from the Global South, vulnerable communities, and youth.”

In October 2025, the Mission hosted a fellowship gathering to honour Sri Lankan nationals who have served across the United Nations system. Ambassador Jayasuriya recognised their contributions, stating, “Those of you working in the UN today carry forward a proud legacy built by generations of Sri Lankans who have distinguished themselves as diplomats, jurists, scholars, peacekeepers, and international civil servants.”

Through these events, Sri Lanka reaffirmed its enduring commitment to the United Nations and to working constructively with fellow Member States to strengthen multilateralism and advance shared global goals in the decades ahead.
