US Ambassador Julie Chung called on Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya last week at the Parliament of Sri Lanka and discussed matters of bilateral interest.

During the meeting Ambassador Julie Jiyoon Chung noted the progress of Peace Corps initiatives and other collaborative programs in education and cultural exchange carried out by United Nations, underscoring educational ties between the two countries along with Fulbright international exchange program.

The Fulbright Program, the United States Government’s flagship program of international educational and cultural exchange, offers passionate and accomplished students and scholars in more than 160 countries the opportunity to study, teach, conduct research, exchange ideas, and contribute to mutual understanding.

During the discussion, the Prime Minister highlighted the need for technical expertise in the areas of Ministry of Education, Department of Examinations and National Institute of Education to support Sri Lanka’s ongoing education reforms, particularly in shifting from an examination-based system toward formative assessments and collaborative learning environment and also further emphasized the importance of emerging scholars whose expertise aligns with the country’s human development priorities.

The meeting was attended by senior officials from both sides. The delegation included Public Affairs Officer Menaka Nayyar, US-Sri Lanka Fulbright Commission Executive Director Dr. Patrick McNamara, and University Grants Commission Centre for Gender Equity/Equality and Prevention of SGBV and Ragging Director Prof. Prabha Manurathne.
