Reconnect Or Risk Lives: Sri Lanka’s Most Urgent Need In The Disaster Zone

As floodwaters rise and families remain stranded across multiple districts, Sri Lanka faces a life-or-death challenge that goes beyond rainfall, rescue boats or relief supplies. The country’s most urgent necessity at this moment is connectivity — the ability to link victims, responders, authorities and volunteers into one functioning rescue network. Without it, even the best resources are misdirected, delayed or rendered useless.

Across towns and villages, families are trapped on upper floors, stranded on rooftops or isolated by rising water. Many have no electricity, no phone signal and no way of alerting the outside world.

For them, the most painful uncertainty is not the floodwater — it is not knowing whether help is coming.

Disaster management teams, health workers, police, the Tri-forces and emergency authorities depend on real-time information to identify the worst-affected pockets.

But power failures, damaged phone towers, inaccessible roads and overwhelmed hotlines mean that critical data is not flowing fast enough.

* Resources get duplicated in one area and absent in another

Civil volunteers, youth groups, religious institutions and neighbourhood teams have mobilised across the country.

But without coordination, their efforts remain scattered and sometimes unsafe.

However, many lack power, communication tools and organised channels to feed this information into national systems.

They are the nerve centres of the crisis, and they must be re-enabled immediately.

Electricity restoration is essential not only for households but for:

Likewise, clearing key access roads determines how quickly boats, ambulances, supplies and recovery teams can reach cut-off communities.

Every hour these two remain disrupted, the humanitarian risk deepens.

To prevent further tragedy, Sri Lanka must urgently establish a Unified Crisis Connectivity Network, bringing together:

Every missing link in the communication chain represents a person waiting in fear, a child stranded without food, or an elder with no medication.

The country has the manpower, the goodwill and the capacity.
