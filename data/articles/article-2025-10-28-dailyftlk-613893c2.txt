Opposition alliance to launch joint campaign on 21 Nov., SJB opts out

Opposition parties, including the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), United National Party (UNP), and National Freedom Front (NFF), yesterday announced the launch of a joint campaign against the Government, beginning with a large rally in Nugegoda on 21 November.

Leaders of the alliance said they plan to hold a series of rallies across the country as part of the movement. They compared their collaboration to the coalition of forces that united against Adolf Hitler during World War II, saying the campaign would symbolise a united stand for the country’s future.

The coalition is formed under the banner “Maha Jana Handa” (Voice of the People).

Organisers said the campaign will focus on issues of governance, corruption, and democratic decline, and will include a series of rallies across the country.

The Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), however, was notably absent from the media briefing announcing the alliance. Although the party had been listed among the participating groups, no SJB representative attended the event.

SJB MP S.M. Marikkar said yesterday that the party would not take part in the proposed rally.

Other parties joining the alliance are: Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU), Mahajana Eksath Party, National Freedom Front (NFF), Sri Lanka Mahajana Party, and Nava Janatha Peramuna.
