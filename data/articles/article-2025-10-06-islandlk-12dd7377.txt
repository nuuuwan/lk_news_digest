FitsAir celebrates three years of passenger operations

FitsAir, Sri Lanka’s first privately-owned international airline, celebrates three years of international scheduled passenger operations, marking another defining moment in its journey to transform air travel for Sri Lankans.

The past year has been one of exceptional growth and achievements for the airline. FitsAir successfully launched Kuala Lumpur as a new destination on its network, expanded frequencies to Malé and Dhaka in response to strong demand, and most recently secured approvals to undertake its own ground handling operations at Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport, a major step that cements the airline’s commitment to independence, efficiency, and service excellence.

Speaking on the anniversary, Ammar Kassim, Director, FitsAir, said, “FitsAir’s growth story is one of resilience, and bold vision. As we celebrate three years of passenger operations, we’re entering a new phase of growth, expanding our network, strengthening our operations, and investing in our people and systems. Our focus remains the same: to build a modern, efficient, and proudly Sri Lankan airline that makes regional travel simpler and more affordable.”
