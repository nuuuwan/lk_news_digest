WNPS urges halt to Mandaitivu Cricket Stadium over environmental concerns

The Wildlife and Nature Protection Society of Sri Lanka (WNPS) has warned in a formal letter addressed to President Anura Kumara Dissanayake that the development of the proposed Jaffna International Cricket Stadium and Sports Complex on Mandaitivu Island is not only unlawful, but poses a serious threat to Mandaitivu’s fragile ecosystems and local communities.

In its letter, the WNPS highlights that the site contains ecologically sensitive habitats, including mangroves, seagrass beds, salt marshes, and the Mandaitivu Forest Reserve. The Society emphasised that Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC), the organisation behind the project, has not obtained the legally required permits under the Coast Conservation and Coastal Resource Management Act before commencing construction activities.

The WNPS clarified that its objection is not to the development of a sports facility in Jaffna, but to the placement of the project on Mandaitivu Island and the failure of Sri Lanka Cricket to comply with environmental law. Further, proceeding with construction without the required approvals constitutes as a clear violation of the law, under the Coast Conservation and Coastal Resource Management Act. The Society is therefore calling for immediate intervention to halt the project before irreversible environmental damage occurs.

WNPS further notes that Mandaitivu is designated as a natural flood-retention zone and is regularly submerged during the rainy season. Its role in safeguarding Jaffna’s limited forest cover makes the island unsuitable for large-scale construction. Additionally, if built, the complex would be prone to frequent flooding and inaccessibility, resulting in continual repair costs and raising serious concerns about the wasteful use of allocated resources.

The Society also expressed concern over misinformation provided to authorities, potentially undermining Sri Lanka’s commitment to sustainable and green development. The WNPS has requested the President to halt the project immediately and investigate the guidance given to SLC regarding the site. The WNPS calls for adherence to environmental laws and careful consideration of ecological and community well-being in all development planning.
