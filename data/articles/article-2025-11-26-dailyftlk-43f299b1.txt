In a ground-breaking step toward digital transformation, the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka recently introduced the digital signature for the President’s Counsel Oath Ceremony marking the first-ever use of this technology in the history of Sri Lanka’s Judiciary. Traditionally, this process was carried out manually, making today’s achievement a historic milestone.

This advancement reflects the Supreme Court’s firm commitment to modernising Judicial operations. The Court has already launched a web-based Case Management System (CMS), establishing a strong digital foundation for a more efficient and technology driven justice process.

Beginning in 2026, the Supreme Court will initiate the phased rollout of the e-Filing system, enabling Attorneys-at-Law to file applications electronically. This system is expected to expand progressively to courts island-wide, improving convenience, accessibility, and speed for legal practitioners and the public.

Today’s successful implementation of the digital signature process underscores the Court’s determination to embrace innovation and lead the digital transformation of the Judicial Sector.

From 21 November onwards, 532 newly enrolled Attorneys-at-Law were admitted to the Bar through the digital signature process during their oath ceremonies. Chief Justice Preethi Padman Surasena, commenced this historic initiative by completing 90 enrolments on 21 November symbolising the Judiciary’s decisive step into a modern digital era.

The Supreme Court remains committed to continuing this digitalisation journey, ensuring greater transparency, accessibility, and efficiency for all stakeholders in the Justice system.
