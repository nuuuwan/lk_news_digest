Ex-CPC Chief arrested over corruption probe

Former Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) Chairman Dhammika Ranatunga was taken into custody yesterday by officers of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) in connection with an ongoing investigation.

CIABOC said the arrest relates to alleged irregularities surrounding the cancellation of three long-term fuel procurement tenders during the 2017–2018 period. The cancelled contracts are alleged to have been replaced with spot purchases at substantially higher prices.

Investigators allege that the move resulted in a financial loss of close to Rs. 800 million to the CPC.

Ranatunga was due to be produced before the Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court in connection with further proceedings.
