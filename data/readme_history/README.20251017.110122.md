# 🇱🇰 Sri Lanka This Week
*Generated at 11:00 AM (October 17, 2025) by gpt-5 from 178 English News Articles published between 2025-10-10 and 2025-10-17.*

## Markets deliver a broad-based rebound even as households feel the pinch.  
Risk appetite returned to Sri Lankan assets, with the CSE posting back-to-back high-turnover sessions (Rs. 8.5 b on 10 Oct; Rs. 8.9 b on 16 Oct) driven by banks, diversified financials and crossings in blue chips, while total market cap surpassed Rs. 8 trillion. Trade and logistics also firmed: Sri Lanka Customs recorded its single highest daily revenue at Rs. 24.9 b (15 Oct), Colombo Port posted a YTD Aug post-tax profit of Rs. 32.2 b (up 71% y/y), and said it could handle a record **8.2 m TEUs in 2025** as the West Container Terminal ramps up. Remittances reached **$ 695.7 m in September** (up $140.1 m y/y), taking 9M inflows to **$ 5.81 b (+16.7% y/y)**. Against this macro-strength, gold hit fresh highs (22k sovereign Rs. 337,600), signalling persistent inflation hedging and dollar demand.

## The State is accelerating rule-of-law and revenue digitisation to restore credibility and cashflows.  
Colombo is layering compliance and digital rails across enforcement and taxation: the FIU will sign MoUs with Vatican City and Mauritius to strengthen cross-border AML/CFT cooperation; the anti-graft commission CIABOC launched a Case-File Tracking System with UNDP/Japan backing; and Cabinet cleared a Rs. 1.3 b integrated revenue administration system for the Excise Department. Parliament will also debate amendments to the Personal Data Protection Act next week to refine guardrails as the public sector digitises. Customs simultaneously adopted a pragmatic stance, allowing release of vehicles imported under mismatched LCs subject to bonds and dues—balancing legality with clearing backlogs.

## Hard infrastructure is being tuned for throughput while policy pivots aim to de-risk investors.  
Cabinet approved procurement for a **Rs. 1.45 b** modernisation of Zone 7 fuel filling at Kolonnawa Terminal to improve safety and capacity, and greenlit amendments to the 2021 Port City law to clarify incentives following the August repeal of strategic business regulations. At sea, the SLPA plans to double Colombo’s capacity to **15 m TEUs by 2026**, while onshore independent power sees new project flow (a 10 MW wind farm in Puttalam announced with Rs. 4.2 b capex). Yet energy transition economics remain fragile: the CEB’s Rs. 45.80/kWh evening feed-in for battery-backed rooftop solar is commercially attractive on paper (simple payback ~6–8 years), but prevailing borrowing costs (15–18%) stretch payback beyond a decade, underscoring the need for concessional green finance.

## Corporate governance and tax morale are under the spotlight as capital markets deepen.  
Board capacity-building advanced with SLID pushing AI oversight, succession and ESG integration; new directors were appointed at listed entities (e.g., Lanka Ventures/LVL Energy; LAUGFS Gas/Power), and events promoted SME governance and youth-centric workplaces. Parallel commentary urged predictable taxation, simpler customs, and lower non-tariff barriers to crowd-in FDI, while a policy blueprint to raise “tax morale” linked transparency in spending to voluntary compliance—vital as Customs revenue targets (Rs. 2.11 tn in 2025) anchor fiscal consolidation. The BOI, meanwhile, courted US think tanks and investors, pitching sectoral zones and reforms to convert macro-stability into inflows.

## Social order and consumer protection measures expanded alongside narcotics interdictions.  
Cabinet approved a national ‘Ratama Ekata’ rapid-response anti-drug operation, coinciding with a major multi-agency seizure of over **830 kg** of cocaine, methamphetamine and hashish off the southern coast. Police also warned of predatory online/mobile loans by unregulated lenders and arrested multiple suspects in foreign employment scams, as regulators move to tighten oversight. The Government plans to issue short-term Dollar bonds within the existing legal framework to ease liquidity, and Customs hit new revenue peaks—signals of a tighter enforcement-and-finance posture.

## Geneva scrutiny persists even as devolution and provincial polls return to the domestic agenda.  
Sri Lanka did not force a vote at the UNHRC on the latest resolution, drawing Opposition fire but preserving room for cooperation-based engagement. The text again calls for implementing the 13th Amendment and holding long-pending Provincial Council elections. The Government says PC polls will be held next year—either under the old system via a quick legal fix or a revised framework—seeking to reconcile devolution commitments with electoral clarity. As the 25th anniversary of Sirimavo Bandaranaike’s passing is marked—the world’s first woman PM and an architect of non-alignment—the devolution debate she helped frame returns with renewed urgency.

## Health policy mixed signals: procurement ramps up, but distribution frictions and gaps endure.  
Cabinet approved multiple medicine tenders—including epoetin (2.25 m syringes), infliximab (24,000 vials), antibiotics and consumables—while the Health Ministry targets easing shortages by early 2026. Yet frontline doctors warn of concurrent oversupply of nearly 100 SKUs and critical scarcities (e.g., IV vasopressors, key antibiotics, cardiac drugs), blaming fragmented planning and high-cost ad hoc buys. Separately, digital health expanded with a mental-wellbeing platform launch (eMindCare) to increase access to psychiatry and counselling—small but notable shifts toward preventive care.

## Trade mechanics eased while productive sectors gained export and labour momentum.  
Migrant mobility continued, with **3,000+** workers bound for South Korea YTD and nearly **36,745** registered for the Korean language test, reinforcing remittance flows. Courts upheld fair access to Samanalawewa for tourism operators, supporting diversified rural incomes. On the export-industrial front, a local engineering firm won a **$156,000** Kenyan order for a hydraulic infrastructure machine, showing niche potential beyond garments. Agriculture saw mechanisation pilots (tea/paddy drones, robotic coconut harvesters), addressing labour shortages and productivity—pragmatic steps toward “spending smarter” growth.

## The reform machine is running, but credibility now rests on delivery sequencing and inclusion.  
From AML MoUs to case-tracking, excise digitalisation, and Customs’ record collections, the State is tightening systems. Ports and energy upgrades target throughput; Port City amendments seek to de-risk investors. Markets and remittances are buoyant, yet households face high financing costs and health-system stockouts; rooftop solar economics hinge on concessional credit. With UNHRC oversight continuing, **holding PC elections in 2025**, executing data protection rules, and aligning tax administration with visible service delivery would convert today’s compliance-heavy stabilisation into durable confidence—and ensure the rebound reaches beyond boardrooms to streets.

## Model Prompt (for gpt-5)

```
You will be given several Sri Lankan news articles from the past few days. Write a concise, cohesive editorial digest in the style of The Economist.

Go beyond summary — analyze and interpret the week’s developments into a unified narrative.

Use markdown level 2 headings (##) as crisp, but completely informative subheadings (which should be a complete sentence), each followed by a short, descriptive paragraph (not bullets) that adds context and nuance. Don't include a summary subheading. Each heading should be independent.

Highlight key facts and trends in bold. Show rather than tell where possible. Anchor numbers and statistics in context in parentheses for meaning.

Stick to verifiable facts; exclude opinion, speculation or emotion. 

Use emojis purposefully for tone or clarity.

Explain non-obvious acronyms, jargon and technical terms in parentheses.

Follow correct GitHub Markdown styling. E.g. Spaces after headings.
```
