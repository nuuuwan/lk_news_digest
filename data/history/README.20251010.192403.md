## Sri Lanka’s recovery edges forward as the IMF signs off another tranche and markets rally, but the macro footing remains narrow.  

IMF staff reached a staff‑level agreement on Sri Lanka’s fifth EFF review, unlocking about **US$347 million** upon Board approval, conditional on the 2026 Budget and financing assurances. Headline indicators are improving: GDP grew **4.8% y/y in 2025H1**, inflation returned to **1.5% y/y (Sept.)**, and gross reserves hit **US$6.1 billion (end‑Sept.)**. Equities responded: block trades drove daily turnover above **Rs. 7–8 billion**, and the exchange rehearsed full‑day trading from its disaster‑recovery site. Yet risks are visible in a jumpy external backdrop, a rupee around **Rs. 302–306/US$**, and record global bullion—gold above **US$4,000/oz** pushed local 22k sovereigns past **Rs. 300,000**—signalling persistent risk hedging. 📈  

## Power sector reform pivots back to state control, inviting union pushback and complicating investment. 🔌  

Parliament’s 2025 amendments to last year’s electricity law re‑centralise decision‑making, limit licenses to state entities, and fold assets into Treasury‑owned successors—reversing the 2024 unbundling blueprint that aimed to crowd‑in capital and competition. Engineers and broader CEB unions have escalated action, alleging procedural breaches and opaque assignations. The IMF urges SOE governance and cost‑recovery to stick; the CEB still needs multi‑billion‑dollar capex over the next two decades, but new limits on private participation raise a financing question the Budget cannot easily answer.  

## The anti‑corruption drive is arming up digitally, even as appointments are contested and the courts reopen old wounds.  

The bribery commission (CIABOC) launched a **case‑tracking system** (Japan/UNDP‑supported) to tighten transparency and timelines, aligning with UNCAC. At the same time, Parliament debates over the DG’s appointment have spilled into the chamber; the Government defends the process and points critics to the Supreme Court. Separately, the Supreme Court granted leave in three FR petitions over the **2021** arrest of former CID chief Shani Abeysekara, signalling continued judicial scrutiny of past politicisation. The net effect is mixed: better tools, but governance rows that cloud credibility.  

## Trade openness is back on the agenda, but compliance and cash‑flow strains will test exporters.  

Economists argue Sri Lanka must “trade its way to recovery” after exports slid from **~30% to ~20% of GDP** since 2000, with product/market concentration. The end of SVAT on **1 Oct** ushers in a risk‑based VAT refund scheme (target **45‑day** refunds for low/medium‑risk filers) that could improve discipline but strain liquidity in the transition; tight October/November schedules ask for RAMIS readiness. Meanwhile, investors and officials are framing December’s SLEIS as a platform for private‑sector‑led growth, and Port City signed its first IT Park tenant in climate‑finance tech (Xeptagon), hinting at services‑export potential.  

## Foreign policy has shrunk from proactive non‑alignment to damage control, as Geneva moved without a vote and sanctions spillovers loom. 🌐  

The latest UNHRC resolution on Sri Lanka was adopted “without a vote”, after Colombo rejected it but did not marshal a division—an outcome critics say underscored thinning alliances. In parallel, the United States sanctioned a network moving Iranian petroleum/LPG, naming shipments that reached Sri Lanka in late **2024/early 2025** via UAE intermediaries and Panama/Palau‑flagged vessels; OFAC warned of secondary sanctions. Colombo’s stance that exposure is limited contrasts with structural dependence on regional energy traders—a reminder that compliance risks can arrive by sea as well as in court.  

## Green and resilient finance is trickling in, but execution capacity is the swing factor.  

AIIB’s president pledged continued support, prioritising green energy and transport; CDRI granted **Rs. 142 million** for climate‑resilient water safety planning at Ambatale (serving >2 million). UNICEF flagged Sri Lanka’s child displacement from climate disasters at **4.6% of under‑18s (2016–22)**—third‑highest in South Asia—mostly from storms and floods. The policy challenge is to translate pledges into shovel‑ready grids, renewables and adaptation, while stabilising SOE finances and permitting rules.  

## A tech‑and‑capital mini‑surge is visible—from AI assistants and drones to exchange plumbing—but governance must keep pace. 🤖  

Slack and global AI builders touted new context protocols; locally, Futurity will deploy an AI assistant at Techno 2025, and Sumathi IT unveiled the first **DJI Dock 3** for automated public‑safety missions. The CSE stress‑tested its DR site; corporate actions (debentures, equity raises, board moves) are ticking up; and Port City continues its tenant build‑out. Yet experts warn AI can amplify market manipulation and misinformation, outpacing rulebooks—underscoring the need for smarter surveillance and disclosure, not just new apps.  

## Social policy is moving fast—child rights, online safety and schools—but capacity, clarity and due process are lagging. ⚖️  

Debate intensifies over child‑protection reforms (including an outright ban on corporal punishment) and the promised overhaul of the Online Safety Act, with calls to swap commission‑centric takedowns for fast, cooperative platform channels. The Prime Minister set an ambition for all teachers to become degree‑holders by upgrading **19** training colleges. Meanwhile, rights concerns persist: a Jaffna lawyers’ strike over a warrantless search, civil‑society protests at surveillance of a Tamil journalist, and the Justice Minister’s refusal to air live Easter‑attack probe details while inquiries continue. Policy intent is clear; institutional readiness is not.  

## The state is still doing heavy lifting, but private capital is edging back—if policy stays predictable.  

State lenders, SOEs and ministries announced moves from new bank headquarters to dividend remittances (**Rs. 757.4 million** from five SOEs) and crude‑supply procurement for **Jan–Apr 2026**. In the private sector, logistics, apparel and renewable‑energy appointments, plus venture‑funding awards, point to tentative animal spirits. The open question is whether power‑sector reversals, legal churn and uneven diplomacy blunt that momentum—or whether the IMF‑anchored discipline, cleaner tax administration and targeted green finance keep the flywheel turning. 🚦

## Model Prompt

```
You will be given several Sri Lankan news articles from the past few days. Write a concise, cohesive editorial digest in the style of The Economist.

Go beyond summary — analyze and interpret the week’s developments into a unified narrative.

Use markdown level 2 headings (##) as crisp, but completely informative subheadings (which should be a complete sentence), each followed by a short, descriptive paragraph (not bullets) that adds context and nuance.

Highlight key facts and trends in bold. Show rather than tell where possible. Anchor numbers and statistics in context in parentheses for meaning.

Stick to verifiable facts; exclude opinion, speculation or emotion. 

Use emojis purposefully for tone or clarity.

Follow correct GitHub Markdown styling. E.g. Spaces after headings.
