## Sri Lanka clears another IMF hurdle, but sustained growth now depends on credible reforms and export dynamism.  
IMF staff reached a fifth-review staff-level agreement, unlocking about **US$ 347 million** (taking disbursements to roughly **US$ 2.04 billion**) once Board conditions are met, after the economy grew **4.8% y/y in H1 2025**, inflation eased (**1.5% y/y** in September) and reserves reached **US$ 6.1 billion**. The Fund’s message was unchanged: guard hard-won stability with a 2026 Budget aligned to program parameters, stick to cost-reflective energy pricing and SOE governance, and accelerate debt deals. The harder part is medium-term: broaden the tax base; reduce the anti‑export bias; and “trade your way to recovery,” as one economist put it, reversing the slide from exports worth ~**30% of GDP** (circa 2000) to ~**20%** today.

## Markets took comfort from reform momentum even as global risk hedging intensified.  
The Colombo bourse rallied after the IMF signal (ASPI **+0.51%** to **22,209.83**), with deep crossings in banks and diversifieds; the CSE also ran a full-day disaster-recovery trading drill to test operational resilience. By contrast, safe-haven fever broke records: Pettah’s 22-carat sovereign crossed **Rs. 300,000** as spot gold topped **US$ 4,000/oz**—a reminder that global turbulence and rate-cut bets remain live. The rupee hovered near **Rs. 302.7** per US dollar; T-bond yields were broadly steady, a sign the policy anchor still holds.

## Electricity reform is drifting back toward centralisation, clouding investment and the renewables build‑out.  
Engineers and unions escalated opposition as assignations and asset transfers proceeded without a “coherent roadmap,” while Parliament faces pleas for oversight. The 2025 amendment narrowed private participation and re-concentrated control, even as the grid needs an estimated **US$ 5 billion** in new capital (2025‑44) and the IMF forbids easy sovereign backstops. The risk is strategic: slower unbundling, weaker dispatch discipline, and politicised governance raise the cost of power—and delay the shift to lower‑cost wind and solar—just as AIIB signalled support for “green energy and transport.”

## Governance reform advanced by technology but is undermined by politicised appointments.  
CIABOC launched a digital Case Tracking System (with UNDP/Japan support) to tighten timelines and transparency—aligning with UNCAC. Yet controversy over the Director‑General’s selection persists, with ministers defending the Constitutional Council’s process and critics urging Supreme Court review. The government also says those attacking CIABOC have “vested interests,” even as it touts anti‑corruption independence. The optics are mixed: digitisation helps, but trust rests on legally unassailable appointments and consistent enforcement, including against sitting officials.

## Digital rulemaking returns to centre stage as authorities balance harm reduction with rights—and as scams spread.  
Calls to delete the most speech‑restrictive clauses of the **2024 No. 09 Online Safety Act** and to scrap its Commission model are growing, in favour of a faster SL‑CERT/TRC “green-channel” takedown unit and clear judicial appeals. Meanwhile, police warned of rising Telegram/WhatsApp fraud—credential theft via links/QRs, fake jobs, and mule-account requests—urging the public to distrust unsolicited messages and never share OTPs. The policy test is to curb online harms without reviving criminal defamation by stealth—especially with elections ahead.

## Applied innovation is stirring: from autonomous drones for public safety to climate‑finance rails and AI-enabled expos.  
Sumathi IT unveiled the country’s first DJI Dock 3, enabling remotely scheduled drone missions for disaster response, mapping and monitoring. Climate‑tech firm Xeptagon became the first tenant operational at Port City’s IT Park, exporting Article 6‑aligned registries and carbon‑market infrastructure across **10+** countries, while Futurity will power an AI assistant at Techno 2025 for real‑time visitor guidance. These are small steps, but they signal a pivot toward service exports with network effects—exactly what Sri Lanka needs to diversify beyond tea and apparel.

## External risks intruded via sanctions and rights fora, underlining the cost of policy drift.  
Washington sanctioned a web of firms and vessels facilitating Iranian petroleum/LPG exports—some consignments reportedly reached Sri Lanka in late 2024/early 2025 via UAE intermediaries and ships now blacklisted—raising due‑diligence demands for energy buyers and banks. In Geneva, the latest Human Rights Council resolution on Sri Lanka was adopted “without a vote” after Colombo declined to force one—ceding terrain on a mechanism (OSLAP) it formally rejects. Diplomacy without disciplined coalition‑building invites outcomes by default.

## Social services are being asked to do more with less, while climate risk is already eroding welfare.  
The government moved to resolve a dialysis needle shortfall after a supplier failed specs, and to elevate all teacher training colleges to degree‑awarding level (only Kuliyapitiya qualifies today). UNICEF estimates about **280,000** Sri Lankan children (**4.6%** of under‑18s) were displaced by weather disasters (2016‑22), mainly storms and floods; a wetlands‑and‑wellness conference this week linked biodiversity to mental health and sustainable tourism. Adaptation finance—and pre‑arranged instruments like parametric insurance—will have to scale if resilience is to keep pace with risk. 🌧️

## The state is trying to do more with better balance sheets, but capital discipline still matters.  
SOEs under the Industries Ministry remitted **Rs. 757.4 million** in interim dividends; the Treasury named a new Deputy Secretary; People’s Bank opened a **22‑storey** “green” headquarters while touting **80%** of its digital transactions outside the Western Province and a loan book reaching roughly one‑fifth of the population. Elsewhere, Cabinet approved a **Rs. 3.04 billion** Ratmalana airfield facility, and the CPC picked BB Energy Asia for Murban crude deliveries in Jan–Apr **2026**. Such moves are best judged against transparent project appraisals and the IMF’s public‑finance rules.

## Public order and safety cut both ways: decisive interdictions and fraught politics.  
Police seized over **18 kg** of narcotics (incl. **12 kg** heroin) in Kadawatha; the Army’s **76th** anniversary passed with multi‑faith blessings; a monk began a fast against reduced security for a former president; and lawyers in Jaffna protested a police search allegedly conducted without a warrant. These episodes capture the balance the state must strike: uphold due process while sustaining security sector professionalism—and communicate decisions clearly to avoid costly misperceptions.

## The microeconomy continues to hum—from tea laurels to capital raising—even as policy choices loom large.  
A charity auction in Osaka fetched record prices (up to **¥125,000/kg**) for Ceylon specialty teas, while Telbedde Estate won overall Gold; LB Finance plans to raise **Rs. 20 billion** via debentures; LAUGFS Power named a new CEO; and dividend‑paying SOEs pledged higher output targets. Against these tailwinds, exporters face the EU’s due‑diligence regime (EUDR): non‑compliance would cut rubber output and jobs (Verité estimates a **15.6%** labour hit). Treating compliance as a competitiveness strategy—simplifying tariffs, digitising border procedures, and investing in skills—will separate the winners.

## Model Prompt

```
You will be given several Sri Lankan news articles from the past few days. Write a concise, cohesive editorial digest in the style of The Economist.

Go beyond summary — analyze and interpret the week’s developments into a unified narrative.

Use markdown level 2 headings (##) as crisp, but completely informative subheadings (which should be a complete sentence), each followed by a short, descriptive paragraph (not bullets) that adds context and nuance.

Highlight key facts and trends in bold. Show rather than tell where possible. Anchor numbers and statistics in context in parentheses for meaning.

Stick to verifiable facts; exclude opinion, speculation or emotion. 

Use emojis purposefully for tone or clarity.

Explain non-obvious acronyms, jargon and technical terms in parentheses.

Follow correct GitHub Markdown styling. E.g. Spaces after headings.
