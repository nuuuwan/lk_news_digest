## Sri Lanka pivots from stabilisation to growth, but credibility now matters as much as momentum.  
A year after averting default’s aftershocks, Sri Lanka is trying to move from IMF-led stabilisation to investment-led expansion. Markets have noticed: the CSE’s ASPI hit a record **23,000** and corporates posted muscular results (John Keells’ Q2 EBITDA up **127%** to Rs. **18.36bn**; NDB’s 9M pre-tax profit up **62%**; HNB Assurance Life GWP up **38%**). Foreign-facing firms are leaning in: Colombo Dockyard signed its largest-ever order to build two cable ships for Orange Marine; Rakuten Symphony and SLT-Mobitel will run one of South Asia’s first Open RAN trials; M&A continues (SolarIT acquiring Tetris; JAT Exports buying Mirotone NZ for A$ **4m**). Yet none of this will carry far if institutions stumble. Allegations around the release of “309 containers” at Customs, police procurement leaks and politicised extensions jar with the Government’s reform message. Investor confidence is rising; policy credibility must keep pace.

## The Budget should lock in certainty on tax and tilt policy from collection to compliance, affordability and growth.  
With the 2026 Budget upon us, the market wants fewer surprises and steadier signals: maintain fiscal consolidation but reduce the cost of doing business, deepen listings (including SOEs), and ease foreign re-entry. On taxes, several voices urge pragmatism: introduce credits for firms that digitise (e‑invoicing, ERP, cyber‑security), a simplified presumptive regime for the service gig economy (3–5% on gross receipts) and a real‑time taxpayer dashboard to cut friction. Others caution that tax morale depends on fairness: keep rates and thresholds steady while using data to widen the net and improve enforcement—without tipping willing payers into non‑compliance. The lesson, as one analyst put it, is simple: growth needs macro prudence, but prosperity needs micro predictability.

## The state’s anti-drug push is sweeping, but long-term gains will come from justice-system throughput and rehabilitation.  
The Government has launched a high‑profile drug offensive—nearly **1,000 arrests** in a day, deep-sea seizures (≈Rs. **5 bn** worth), and a new operations centre to fuse police, military, Customs and immigration. The hotline (1995/1818) and a turn to voluntary treatment are signs of a broader intent: from fear to prevention. The risk is familiar: dragnet arrests that clog courts and prisons, while upstream networks adapt. Sustainable progress needs measurable targets—kingpin convictions, asset forfeiture, fewer youth initiations—and insulation from politicisation. The state must also fix what it demands of citizens: due process, clean procurement, and no impunity for collusion.

## The Northern economy is back on the policy map; turning potential into exports demands ports, power and people.  
A drumbeat of analysis and advocacy (think‑tank papers, business forums and an announced Northern Summit in January) frames the North and East as Sri Lanka’s “Northern Gateway”—close to Indian markets, rich in fisheries and agriculture, with ports (KKS, Point Pedro) and the Palaly airport as anchors. Private and diaspora capital are awakening; public policy should follow with hard infrastructure (cold chains, last‑mile logistics, grid capacity), streamlined land use and cross‑border services. The blue economy is the obvious fulcrum; governance (traceability, IUU control) is the hinge.

## Tourism’s recovery is labour‑constrained; fix skills, not just visas.  
NHRDC’s new data are stark: hotels face shortages in kitchens (**35%**), F&B (**22.8%**), and housekeeping (**16.6%**); women are just **24%** of the workforce; over **60%** of exits (2020–23) were to overseas jobs. Training pipelines are skewed (3,000+ in cookery vs. <200 in guest relations) and curricula behind the curve (multilingual skills, digital hospitality). Retention will demand structured apprenticeships, flexible shifts, safer workplaces and career ladders—especially for women. If Sri Lanka wants higher‑yield visitors, it must first invest in higher‑skill service.

## Climate and circularity inch from CSR to core, but policy coherence lags.  
Corporate moves are getting bolder: Allianz Lanka tethers policy sales to ecosystem restoration (PLANT), Bureau Veritas wins Gold for environmental performance, and GP Labs opens the country’s first dedicated plastics testing facility to validate recycled materials to ASTM/ISO standards. Yet public policy sends mixed signals. The bag levy (Rs. **3–5**) may curb demand, but without ring‑fenced revenues for collection and recycling infrastructure it risks being a regressive fee. Likewise, a proposed Hambantota refinery raises unresolved EIA, coastal and biodiversity risks. “Eco” should be engineered as a system—products, recovery, data—not just priced at the checkout.

## Foreign policy is pragmatic and plural; it should be married to trade facilitation and investment execution.  
Sri Lanka’s external calendar is busy and balanced: Korea marked **48 years** of ties (diaspora, KOICA, EPS labour); Archbishop Gallagher’s visit celebrated **50 years** with the Holy See; Tokyo and Seoul welcomed new envoys; Bangladesh FOC and the UAE Joint Commission relaunched after long lulls; the Sri Lanka–Thailand Business Council renewed its agenda as both sides work an FTA. These are good optics. The test is throughput: concluding legal instruments, accelerating approvals, and de‑risking projects with transparent PPP frameworks. Diplomacy feeds pipelines; domestic capacity must close.

## Telecoms, shipbuilding and open standards hint at a productivity turn—if the digital divide is addressed.  
Local manufacturing and network innovation signal movement up the value chain: Colombo Dockyard’s high‑technology vessels for Orange Marine; Open RAN trials to cut vendor lock‑in; and private investments in agritech cold chains and boutique wellness real estate. The IPS 2025 report argues the case: digitalise to reduce trade frictions (e.g., EU deforestation rules), and put smallholders on shared platforms (GIS, blockchain traceability). That will need public rails (payments, identity, data protection), skilling and last‑mile access—plus a regulatory posture that promotes competition without deterring capital.

## The capital market is doing its job; policymakers must avoid crowding it out.  
A record market, oversubscribed IPOs (e.g., JF Packaging), and strong bank fee growth point to risk appetite returning as rates ease. To convert rallies into reform, the state should stick to a predictable issuance calendar, resist ad‑hoc tax tweaks on equities, and sequence SOE listings that broaden the investable universe. Pension funds will need clear, rules‑based room to allocate to equity; foreign investors, clean exits and credible macro anchors.

## Governance will decide whether reform compounds or unravels.  
The Government is moving on several fronts—youth entrepreneurship committees in Parliament, cross‑border energy talks with India, and an integrated forest‑crime unit (Wana Surakuma) with **1995** hotline support. It is also under scrutiny for politicised appointments, Customs controversies and attempts to stretch tenures. The simplest growth policy remains the hardest: enforce rules without fear or favour, publish the findings, and show that the “new” state is smaller where it should be—and stronger where it must be.

## The story of the week: Sri Lanka is back on investors’ screens; to stay there, it must make institutions boring again. 🧭  
There is clear, broad‑based momentum—corporate earnings, market highs, trade missions, and a more assertive green agenda. The risks are equally clear: skills shortages, policy whiplash, enforcement optics, and an overstretched justice pipeline. Growth needs capital; capital needs confidence; confidence needs competent, rules‑based government. That is the compounding Sri Lanka should be aiming for.

## Model Prompt (for [gpt-5](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-5))

```
You will be given several Sri Lankan news articles from the past few days. Write a concise, cohesive editorial digest in the style of The Economist.

Go beyond summary — analyze and interpret the week’s developments into a unified narrative.

Use markdown level 2 headings (##) as crisp, but completely informative subheadings (which should be a complete sentence), each followed by a short, descriptive paragraph (not bullets) that adds context and nuance. Don't include a summary subheading. Each heading should be independent.

Highlight key facts and trends in bold. Show rather than tell where possible. Anchor numbers and statistics in context in parentheses for meaning.

Stick to verifiable facts; exclude opinion, speculation or emotion. 

Use emojis purposefully for tone or clarity.

Explain non-obvious acronyms, jargon and technical terms in parentheses.

Follow correct GitHub Markdown styling. E.g. Spaces after headings.
