## Sri Lanka’s recovery advances under IMF oversight, with 2026 budget the next test 🚦  
IMF staff reached a staff-level agreement on the fifth review of Sri Lanka’s Extended Fund Facility, unlocking about **US$347 million** on Board approval (cumulative disbursements c. **US$2.04 billion**). The Fund flagged two conditions: passage of a **2026 Appropriation Bill aligned to programme parameters** and completion of financing assurances tied to **external debt restructuring (c. US$28 billion)**. Macros are stabilising: GDP grew **4.8% year-on-year in 1H 2025**, reserves reached **US$6.1 billion** (end-September), inflation returned to positive territory (**1.5%** in September). The IMF spotlighted energy-sector reform, cost-reflective pricing, SOE governance and a data‑driven, independent central bank as essential to lock in gains.

## Reform momentum collides with politics in the power sector ⚡  
The Government’s 2025 amendments to the 2024 Electricity Act re‑centralise control and limit private participation in key grid functions, reversing earlier unbundling and market-building measures. Engineers and unions say implementation is breaching the Acts’ own procedures (assignations and asset transfers without complete plans), and have escalated a **month‑long work‑to‑rule** after talks collapsed. The IMF, meanwhile, insists on predictable tariffs and SOE debt workouts in 2026. The clash underscores a structural dilemma: **capital needs exceed public balance-sheet space**, yet policy signals are deterring the very private capital the 2024 law sought to attract.

## Markets cheer stabilisation while risks linger 💰  
Equities rallied on the IMF news: the **ASPI** added **+111.8 points** on the day, with crossings led by banks and conglomerates; turnover repeatedly topped **Rs. 7–8.5 billion**. Gold hit a local record—about **Rs. 303,000** for a 22-carat sovereign—mirroring global bullion above **US$4,000/oz**, reflecting safe‑haven demand and currency dynamics. Government yields stayed broadly steady; the rupee hovered around **Rs. 302–303** per US dollar. The Colombo bourse also tested full‑day trading from its disaster recovery site—useful operational hygiene as volume deepens.

## Governance drive mixes new tools with hard cases 🧑‍⚖️  
The Supreme Court granted leave to proceed in three fundamental rights petitions by former CID Director Shani Abeysekara and two officers over their **August 2021** arrests; arguments are set for **14 May 2026**. Anti‑corruption agency CIABOC launched a **digital Case Tracking System** (with UNDP and Japan funding) to reduce opacity and delay; the Government defended the appointment of its Director General amid criticism, urging challengers to seek judicial review. Separately, police warned of rising **Telegram/WhatsApp** fraud and seized **over 18 kg** of narcotics in Kadawatha, while the CID is handling **20,000+** investigations. The signal: institutional plumbing is upgrading even as legacy cases and capacity constraints strain the system.

## External headwinds: US sanctions brush Sri Lanka via Iran’s ‘shadow fleet’ ⛽  
US Treasury sanctioned entities and vessels tied to Iranian petroleum and LPG flows, citing deliveries to Sri Lanka in late‑2024/early‑2025 via UAE intermediaries and ships including GAS DIOR and MAX STAR. While Sri Lanka’s reported direct imports from Iran are small (**US$2.48 million** in 2024), LPG supply chains traverse sanctioned networks, raising compliance and procurement risks. Cabinet, meanwhile, approved a four‑month **Murban crude** supply contract (Jan–Apr 2026) with **BB Energy Asia**, and green‑lit a **Rs. 3.04 billion** airport works package for Ratmalana.

## State capacity and social policy are being rewired in parallel 🏛️  
The Treasury appointed a new Deputy Secretary (A.N. Hapugala) as fiscal stewardship tightens. The Army marked its 76th anniversary with **7,979** NCO promotions. Education reforms target **degree‑qualified teachers** nationwide (only Kuliyapitiya currently awards degrees), while debate continues over the **Online Safety Act** and proposed amendments to curb vague offences and shift from censorship to rapid platform takedowns. Gambling levies rose (to **18% of gross collections**) and the local casino entry fee for Lankans doubled to **US$100** as the state seeks revenue without broad‑based rate hikes.

## Development finance tilts greener and more resilient 🌱  
The AIIB reiterated support—prioritising **green energy and transport**—in talks with President Anura Kumara Dissanayake. A **Rs. 142 million** grant from the CDRI (backed by India) will harden the Ambatale Water Supply Scheme and align with WHO Water Safety Plan Edition II (benefiting **2+ million** people in Greater Colombo). The IMF urged operationalising an independent **Public Debt Management Office** and passing bills on **PPP, SOEs, procurement and public assets** consistent with the new Public Financial Management Act.

## Transitional justice and electoral plumbing inch forward 🗳️  
The Government said a **Truth and Reconciliation Commission bill** will be presented “soon,” PC elections are planned **next year** (PR vs mixed model under discussion), and a UN electoral needs mission met leaders to scope technical assistance (women’s participation, voter education, digitalisation). Justice officials reiterated that details of the **2019 Easter attacks** probe cannot be disclosed mid‑investigation; Parliament was cautioned against directing premature releases.

## Consumer confidence is cautiously returning, but household risks persist 🙂⚠️  
Cinematic and hospitality promotions point to a busier festive season; airlines and brands backed Children’s Day and skills initiatives. Yet household exposures remain: **vehicle import pent‑up demand** (US$1.5–1.8 billion in 2025) is being watched under the IMF reserve‑build targets; cyber‑fraud is rising; and gold buying at record prices signals precautionary saving. The policy task is to convert market buoyancy and donor projects into broad‑based income growth—without loosening the guardrails that made the rebound possible.

## Model Prompt

```
You will be given several Sri Lankan news articles from the past few days. Write a concise, cohesive editorial digest in the style of The Economist.

Go beyond summary — analyze and interpret the week’s developments into a unified narrative.

Use markdown level 2 headings (##) as crisp, but completely informative subheadings (which should be a complete sentence), each followed by a short, descriptive paragraph (not bullets) that adds context and nuance.

Highlight key facts and trends in bold. Show rather than tell where possible. Anchor numbers and statistics in context in parentheses for meaning.

Stick to verifiable facts; exclude opinion, speculation or emotion. 

Use emojis purposefully for tone or clarity.

Explain non-obvious acronyms, jargon and technical terms in parentheses.

Follow correct GitHub Markdown styling. E.g. Spaces after headings.
```
