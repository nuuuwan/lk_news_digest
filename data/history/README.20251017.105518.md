## Fiscal stabilisation is gaining traction, but 2026 budget discipline will make or break the recovery.  
Sri Lanka secured an IMF staff-level agreement on the fifth EFF review, with access to about $347 million pending two conditions: parliamentary approval of a 2026 Appropriation Bill ‚Äúin line with programme parameters‚Äù and completion of the financing assurances review. The Fund flagged stronger-than-expected macro performance: real GDP grew **4.8% (H1 2025)**; inflation fell to **1.5% (y/y in September)**; and reserves reached **$6.1 billion (end-September)**. Revenue momentum is visible: Sri Lanka Customs posted a record single-day intake of **Rs. 24.9 billion (15 Oct.)**, and cumulative 2025 receipts hit **Rs. 1.86 trillion**. The Colombo Port reported **Rs. 32.2 billion** post-tax profit (Jan‚ÄìAug), and expects throughput of **8.2 million TEUs (2025)** on WCT ramp-up, with capacity to **15 million TEUs (by 2026)**. The IMF cautioned that the 2026 Budget, SOE governance and cost-recovery energy pricing will be critical to lock in gains. üß≠

## Reform momentum is uneven as the electricity restructuring stalls while capital markets deepen.  
Power-sector reforms are contested. Engineers and unions argued the 2025 amendment to the Electricity Act re-centralises governance, restricts licensing to state entities, and clouds investment; they sought parliamentary oversight and paused a month-long work-to-rule after the Minister agreed in principle to **24 union proposals**. The IMF pressed for SOE governance and legacy-debt resolution, with security-constrained dispatch to be balanced against efficiency and renewable integration. In contrast, capital markets are widening: SEC and CSE engaged institutional funds on a ‚Äúresilient market‚Äù agenda; the exchange notched multiple Rs. **8+ billion** turnover days; and new listings and buy-side interest accelerated. Policy back-office upgrades progressed, including Cabinet approval for an **Excise revenue system (Rs. 1.3 b)** and a **Personal Data Protection (Amendment) Bill** tabling.

## External financing and trade flows are normalising, but compliance and sanctions risks are rising.  
Hard-currency inflows improved: worker remittances reached **$695.7 million (Sept.)**, lifting 2025 year-to-date inflows to **$5.81 billion (+16.7% y/y)**; outbound workers to South Korea crossed **3,000 (by mid-Oct.)**, with **36,745** registered for the 2025 language test. Vehicle imports are resuming under tighter customs conditions (LC-country mismatch cases require bonds and fees), and energy procurement is steady: a **4-cargo Murban crude** contract (Jan‚ÄìApr 2026) and **fuel terminal upgrades (Rs. 1.45 b)** were approved. The FIU will sign MoUs with Vatican City and Mauritius to strengthen AML cooperation. But exposure persists: the US sanctioned a network moving Iranian petroleum/LPG to Asia, citing consignments that reached Sri Lanka; and the EU‚Äôs deforestation rule (EUDR) will bind rubber-linked exports by **Dec. 2025/June 2026**. Firms must build geolocation-backed due diligence and align with domestic legal frameworks that span land, labour, and environmental protections. ‚ö†Ô∏è

## The Government is doubling down on narcotics interdiction while justice-sector tensions persist.  
Maritime enforcement yielded a major seizure: the Navy intercepted **839 kg** of narcotics‚Äîprimarily crystal methamphetamine (‚ÄúIce‚Äù: **670 kg**), heroin (**156 kg**) and hashish (**12 kg**)‚Äîafter a tip-off, with five arrests and a boat seized. Colombo launched ‚ÄúRatama Ekata,‚Äù a national anti-drug operation with a new council to coordinate intelligence, interdiction and rehabilitation. Meanwhile, rule-of-law flashpoints drew scrutiny: the Bar Association condemned the assault of a lawyer by a police officer at Mount Lavinia Court; and the Supreme Court granted leave to proceed in three FR petitions connected to the 2021 arrest of ex-CID officials. CIABOC rolled out a **case-file tracking system** with UNDP/Japan support to speed corruption caseflow, and Cabinet backed **Personal Data Protection** amendments to tighten governance of personal information.

## Foreign policy avoided isolated confrontation in Geneva while health diplomacy and ageing policy advanced.  
Sri Lanka did not force a vote on the UNHRC‚Äôs October resolution‚Äîavoiding a divisive roll call while reiterating plans for a Truth and Reconciliation Commission ‚Äúsoon‚Äù and **Provincial Council elections in 2026** (electoral model under review). Colombo chaired the **WHO South‚ÄëEast Asia Regional Committee**, with the **Colombo Declaration** committing countries to ‚Äúhealthy ageing‚Äù via primary care. Separately, the UN ran an electoral needs mission, engaging the PM and Opposition on frameworks to boost participation, women‚Äôs representation and integrity. üïäÔ∏è

## Labour and welfare measures are scaling up, with downstream cost and compliance implications.  
The National Minimum Wage was raised to **Rs. 27,000/month (retroactive to 1 April 2025)**, with a further increase to **Rs. 30,000 (from 1 Jan. 2026)**; all statutory contributions (EPF/ETF), overtime, maternity benefits and holiday pay must be computed on the revised floor. The Government fast-tracked emergency imports of **Ponni/Keeri Samba** and approved **Rs. 2.5 billion** of medical supplies, even as doctors flagged simultaneous oversupply of **~100** drug varieties and shortages of critical medicines/surgical items. HRW linked decades of low tax revenue to chronic underfunding of education (**~1.5% of GDP in 2022**, among the world‚Äôs lowest) and urged progressive tax reforms to rebuild social spending. The IMF echoed the call for revenue mobilisation, predictable policy and prudent expenditure execution.

## Tourism, ports and tech services anchor the growth narrative as investors await Port City clarity.  
Visitor‚Äëeconomy initiatives expanded‚Äîfrom WHO and AIA-hosted conferences to sports‚Äëtourism plans and court‚Äëaffirmed access to Samanalawewa lake for operators. The Colombo Port targets a record **8.2 million TEUs in 2025** (vs. **7.78m in 2024**), anchored by WCT ramp‚Äëup. In IT‚ÄëBPM, Virtusa announced **200+** new roles in AI, data and engineering; multiple IPOs and corporate awards signalled pipeline strength. Cabinet instructed amendments to the **Port City Economic Commission Act (No. 11 of 2021)** to address regulatory gaps and investor concerns after the repeal of strategic business regulations; markets await clarity on incentives, dispute resolution and transparency to restore confidence.

## Governance plumbing is being modernised, but resilience and service quality remain mixed.  
CIABOC‚Äôs digitised case-tracking and **Rs. 202,000** hardware grant, the new **Excise** system, and **MoUs on AML** are incremental steps toward cleaner public finance and better caseflow management. Conversely, a **Lanka Government Cloud outage** disrupted multiple online public services (BMD certificates, e‚Äërevenue licences, police clearance), underscoring the need for redundancy and phased rollouts. Courts green-lit the **release of vehicles held for LC-country mismatches** with bonds, and struck a balance in sanctioning importers while clearing backlog. üìâüìà

## The bottom line: macro repair is real, but credibility now hinges on clean budgets, bankable reforms and regulatory predictability.  
With growth returning, inflation tamed and reserves rebuilt, Sri Lanka‚Äôs next test is execution: a **programme‚Äëcompliant 2026 budget**, energy‚Äësector fixes that attract capital without over‚Äëpoliticisation, trade compliance (EUDR/AML) that preserves market access, and faster justice‚Äësector throughput. Success would unlock cheaper financing, crowd in private investment and shift the narrative from cyclical bounce to structural recovery. Failure would revive risk premia‚Äîand stall the ‚Äúuprise‚Äù before it becomes durable.

## Model Prompt (for gpt-5)

```
You will be given several Sri Lankan news articles from the past few days. Write a concise, cohesive editorial digest in the style of The Economist.

Go beyond summary ‚Äî analyze and interpret the week‚Äôs developments into a unified narrative.

Use markdown level 2 headings (##) as crisp, but completely informative subheadings (which should be a complete sentence), each followed by a short, descriptive paragraph (not bullets) that adds context and nuance. Don't include a summary subheading. Each heading should be independent.

Highlight key facts and trends in bold. Show rather than tell where possible. Anchor numbers and statistics in context in parentheses for meaning.

Stick to verifiable facts; exclude opinion, speculation or emotion. 

Use emojis purposefully for tone or clarity.

Explain non-obvious acronyms, jargon and technical terms in parentheses.

Follow correct GitHub Markdown styling. E.g. Spaces after headings.
```
