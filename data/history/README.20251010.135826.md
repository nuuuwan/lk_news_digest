## A stabilisation milestone lifts markets, but growth must now do the heavy lifting. 📈  
The IMF reached a staff-level agreement on Sri Lanka’s Fifth EFF review, unlocking a potential disbursement of about **$347 million** upon Board approval and hinging on a 2026 budget consistent with program parameters and continued debt-restructuring progress. The economy grew **4.8% year-on-year in 1H 2025**, inflation returned to positive territory (**1.5% y/y in September**), and reserves rose to **$6.1 billion**. Equities rallied on the news (ASPI up **0.5%**), while turnover stayed strong. But the Fund warned of “heightened downside risks” and pressed for tax-base broadening, arrears avoidance, SOE governance, and cost-recovery pricing—echoing domestic analyses that lasting stability depends on export growth and productivity, not just fiscal repair.  

## Power-sector reform is being reshaped in ways that could jeopardise investment and financing. ⚡  
Parliament’s 2025 amendments rolled back key market-opening features of the 2024 Electricity Act—recentralising licensing to state entities, tightening control over successor-company boards, and shifting dispatch priorities to “security-constrained” criteria. Engineers warn the process breaches statutory timelines and lacks a credible transfer plan; unions have escalated work-to-rule action. The policy pivot complicates capital mobilisation for an asset class that needs an estimated multi‑billion‑dollar upgrade while Treasury guarantees are constrained. The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank nevertheless reaffirmed support, with a tilt to **green energy and transport**, but credibility with private developers will turn on regulatory clarity and procurement discipline.  

## Anti-corruption efforts advance in systems, stall in politics. 🛡️  
CIABOC launched a digital Case Tracking System (with UNDP/Japan support) to improve transparency and throughput, while the Government urged critics of its DG’s appointment to seek judicial review. Parliament heard of containers released without inspection—a reminder of enforcement gaps. Separately, the Supreme Court granted leave to hear petitions on the 2021 arrest of former CID Director Shani Abeysekara, signalling continued judicial scrutiny of past police actions. The IMF pressed for faster CIABOC staffing and safeguarding its independence, electronic asset declarations, and procurement reform—linking governance delivery directly to macro credibility.  

## A rights-and-institutions agenda gathers pace, though capacity is the constraint.  
The Government said a Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill would be presented soon and that **Provincial Council elections** are planned for next year; a law to replace the PTA is being finalised. The Prime Minister set a target for all teachers to become degree holders as part of teacher-training reform. Health authorities acknowledged procurement setbacks behind dialysis-needle shortages and moved to emergency buys—an example of how legacy rules impair service delivery. Meanwhile, a Manila declaration on universal access to environmental information urged statutory guarantees and disability‑inclusive systems—policy-aligned with domestic moves to digitise state processes, but still demanding execution capability.  

## Trade and investment outreach accelerates as Colombo courts capital and convenes sectors. 🌍  
Global forums in Colombo—from the AIA International Conference to the upcoming **South Asia Bitumen Conference (13–14 Nov.)**—signalled a return to convening international professionals. The Ceylon Chamber’s December summit will ask “Why Sri Lanka?” to investors, with IFC and multinationals on the docket; economists argue tariff simplification, export diversification, digitised facilitation, and a dedicated trade-negotiation office are prerequisites. Venture Engine showcased startup depth (healthtech and ag‑AI among winners). The stock exchange stress‑tested its disaster‑recovery trading, as corporates pursued restructurings and board refreshes—micro‑signals of a market normalising around risk management.  

## Digital and financial integrity are now front-line issues. 🔐  
Police warned of rising Telegram/WhatsApp scams using spoofed links and QR codes; the Government’s Online Safety Act is under review, with submissions urging the deletion of **vague offences** and a pivot to fast, cooperative takedowns with platforms. Tax administration changed gears as **SVAT was repealed** and a risk‑based VAT refund system went live on **1 October** (low/medium-risk taxpayers to be paid within **45 days**), prompting firms to upgrade RAMIS readiness. Gambling levies rose to **18%** and local casino entry fees doubled to **$100**.  

## Climate risk is material and rising; policy and finance are catching up. 🌱  
UNICEF reported Sri Lanka recorded the region’s third‑highest share of child displacements from climate disasters—about **280,000 children (4.6% of under‑18s) between 2016–22**, mostly due to storms and floods. A UN‑Habitat/NWSDB project, backed by **Rs. 142 million** from the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure, will climate‑proof the Ambatale water safety plan for Greater Colombo. Conferences linked wetlands, mental health, and sustainable tourism; the AIIB emphasised green energy pipelines. These fit a broader shift—regulatory and market—where compliant, traceable, low‑carbon supply chains are becoming non‑negotiable for export survival.  

## External shocks remain a risk vector—from sanctions to safe havens.  
The US sanctioned a network moving Iranian petroleum/LPG via a “shadow fleet,” citing consignments that reached Sri Lanka through UAE intermediaries; parties named now face blocked property under US jurisdiction and secondary-sanctions exposure. Meanwhile, gold extended a historic run (**>$4,000/oz**), pushing local **22k sovereigns past Rs. 300,000**—a barometer of global anxiety and domestic hedging. The rupee and bond yields were broadly steady, but Sri Lanka’s openness to trade and finance leaves it exposed to extraterritorial enforcement and commodity volatility alike.  

## Culture, soft power, and services—quiet tailwinds to the recovery. 🎭✈️  
Architecture’s global elite returned to Colombo; tourism‑linked initiatives—from curated flights for **250** schoolchildren to wellness‑in‑wetlands programming—signal a sector intent on value, not just volume. Specialty tea achieved record charity‑auction prices in Osaka (top lots at **JPY 125,000/kg** and **JPY 65,000/kg**), reinforcing premium positioning. Behind the scenes, logistics and AI‑enablement partnerships point to productivity gains in service industries. These small but cumulative moves matter for a country still targeting an export‑led path out of crisis.  

In sum, the week’s headlines point to a stabilising macro picture and a busier deal calendar. The test is whether policy follow‑through—on power‑market design, SOE governance, trade facilitation, and rule‑of‑law—can convert a rebound into a resilient expansion, with exports and private investment doing more of the work.

## Model Prompt

```
You will be given several Sri Lankan news articles from the past few days. Write a concise, cohesive editorial digest in the style of The Economist.

Go beyond summary — analyze and interpret the week’s developments into a unified narrative.

Use markdown level 2 headings (##) as crisp, but completely informative subheadings (which should be a complete sentence), each followed by a short, descriptive paragraph (not bullets) that adds context and nuance.

Highlight key facts and trends in bold. Show rather than tell where possible. Anchor numbers and statistics in context in parentheses for meaning.

Stick to verifiable facts; exclude opinion, speculation or emotion. 

Use emojis purposefully for tone or clarity.

Follow correct GitHub Markdown styling. E.g. Spaces after headings.
