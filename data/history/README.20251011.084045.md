## IMF’s fifth review signals recovery, but ties disbursement to a 2026 budget that stays the reform course 📈  

The IMF reached staff-level agreement on Sri Lanka’s fifth EFF review, citing **GDP growth of 4.8% (H1 2025)**, **inflation back near target (1.5% y/y in September)** and **gross reserves at $6.1 billion (end-September)**. Approval (and a further **~$347 million**) hinges on Parliament passing a **2026 Appropriation Bill in line with programme parameters** and confirmation of financing assurances. Priorities remain familiar: keep **cost-recovery energy pricing**, speed **SOE governance** and **debt-management reforms**, avoid **expenditure arrears**, and protect **targeted welfare**. Markets took the cue: the CSE posted back‑to‑back **Rs. 8+ billion** sessions, while the rupee held around **Rs. 302.7 per USD**. The message from Washington is unvarnished: growth is returning, but **macroeconomic stability now depends on a disciplined 2026 Budget**, not short‑term giveaways.  

## Electricity reform is drifting from competition to control, even as unions escalate and financing risks rise ⚡  

The sector’s centre of gravity has shifted. The 2024 Act unbundled CEB and opened the door to market discipline; the **2025 amendment recentralises control**, restricts private participation in the grid, and blurs operational independence. Engineers have petitioned Parliament over **assignations before successor companies are legally constituted**, incomplete transfer plans, and **pensions governance gaps**. Meanwhile, CEB unions have **intensified a month‑long work‑to‑rule**, and talks have collapsed. The Energy Minister says restructuring is “crucial” and will proceed, yet unions see a path to future privatisation. The economic risk is clear: without predictable rules and credible governance, **low‑cost private capital for renewables and grid upgrades will remain scarce**, forcing the state to carry a bill it can’t afford under IMF constraints—just as Sri Lanka courts investors for a low‑cost power platform.  

## Governance tools are getting sharper, but credibility hinges on consistent, impartial use 🛡️  

CIABOC launched a **digital case-file tracking system** (with **Japan/UNDP** support) to speed investigations and improve audit trails; new hardware worth **$202,000** underpins roll‑out. Separately, the Government defended the **Constitutional Council–approved** appointment of CIABOC’s DG amid criticism, urging challengers to seek judicial review. In parallel, Police flagged a rise in **Telegram/WhatsApp account‑takeovers** and warned against QR‑phishing and mule‑account traps; the **CID’s caseload exceeds 20,000**, and an **18+ kg narcotics** seizure in Kadawatha underscores organised‑crime pressure. The thrust is positive—more digital rails, more caseload transparency—but public confidence will turn on **even‑handed enforcement** and demonstrable outcomes rather than announcements.  

## Elections are back on the agenda; international partners are ready to support cleaner, more inclusive processes 🗳️  

A **UN Electoral Needs Assessment Mission** met the Prime Minister and Opposition Leader to scope technical support for electoral reforms: **transparency, women’s participation, voter education, digitisation**, and youth inclusion. Government signalled **Provincial Council polls in 2026** and a **Truth and Reconciliation Commission bill** “soon,” as part of broader governance commitments. Follow‑through will matter: **timelines, resourcing and legal clarity** will determine whether these initiatives rebuild trust or add to a crowded reform docket.  

## Trade policy is again the growth lever: compliance and openness are not optional in today’s markets 🌍  

Economists reiterated that Sri Lanka must **“trade its way to recovery,”** reversing an **anti‑export bias** that shrank exports from **~30% to ~20% of GDP** since 2000. Two practical pivots stand out:  
- Treat compliance as a market entry “ticket.” The EU’s green rulebook (e.g., **EUDR**) is already gated; non‑compliance risks **market loss** and **employment hits** (sector estimates: **~15.6%** labour reduction in rubber if non‑compliant).  
- Reduce friction: **tariff simplification, digitised trade facilitation**, and a **dedicated trade‑negotiation office** can unlock agreements and value‑chain integration (where peers like Vietnam have surged).  
A cautionary note: the US Treasury sanctioned entities tied to **Iranian petroleum/LPG exports**, citing **shipments that reached Sri Lanka**—an indicator that **due diligence** and **sanctions‑risk management** are now integral parts of trade logistics, not legal footnotes.  

## Capital markets are buoyant, but policy credibility remains the ballast  

A staff‑level IMF deal, **record CSE turnovers**, and corporate actions (e.g., **LB Finance** debenture plans; **People’s Bank** inaugurating a new head office; **Hayleys** topping LMD 100 with **Rs. 492.2 billion revenue, +13% y/y**) point to rising risk appetite. **Gold at $4,000/oz** pushed Pettah **22k sovereigns above Rs. 300,000**, a reminder of hedging demand amid global uncertainty. The SEC/CSE’s outreach to institutional investors and the **DR-site trading drill** signal a maturing market infrastructure. The anchor remains the **2026 Budget**: fiscal realism will determine whether the rally compounds into capital formation or retreats to safe assets.  

## Public services are reforming—incrementally—toward skills, data and resilience  

Education plans target **degree‑qualified teachers at all 20 training colleges** (only **Kuliyapitiya** currently awards degrees), aligning with curriculum reform. The **Central Bank** released its **48th Sri Lanka Socio‑Economic Data** folder, sustaining statistical transparency. On resilience, **CDRI** awarded **Rs. 142 million** for **Ambatale Water Supply** climate‑proofing (WHO‑aligned Water Safety Plans) to protect **~2 million** in Greater Colombo—one of the week’s most targeted, high‑impact investments.  

## Politics is recalibrating, but coalitions and signals are still in flux  

The **SJB and UNP** agreed to a joint platform under SJB’s lead; the **SLPP** contends the withdrawal of VIP vehicles/security for ex‑Presidents is politically motivated (a monk began a hunger strike in Tangalle), as the Government insists security is assessed by threat. Meanwhile, **South Africa and Sri Lanka** reaffirmed ties, including collaboration on a **truth‑reconciliation model**. The test for all sides will be to **decouple security and institutional reform from day‑to‑day politics**, as fiscal space narrows and the reform agenda thickens.  

## The week’s bottom line: reform momentum is intact, but energy and budget choices will define 2026 outcomes  

- IMF conditionality is now **budget‑linked**; fiscal drift would **jeopardise disbursements** and investor sentiment.  
- **Electricity sector policy** is the swing variable: a credible pathway to **low‑cost, reliable, greener power** demands governance clarity and union buy‑in; reversals deter **long‑tenor capital**.  
- Governance wins (CIABOC digitalisation, elections support) are **necessary but not sufficient**; they must convert into **timely, impartial enforcement** and **cleaner contests**.  
- Trade must be **more open and more compliant**—simultaneously. That is how small economies grow exports in a rules‑heavy world.  

If 2024 was about stabilisation, 2025‑26 is about **institutional credibility**. The numbers are moving the right way; sustaining them will take steady politics, predictable budgets, and reforms that survive the news cycle.

## Model Prompt

```
You will be given several Sri Lankan news articles from the past few days. Write a concise, cohesive editorial digest in the style of The Economist.

Go beyond summary — analyze and interpret the week’s developments into a unified narrative.

Use markdown level 2 headings (##) as crisp, but completely informative subheadings (which should be a complete sentence), each followed by a short, descriptive paragraph (not bullets) that adds context and nuance.

Highlight key facts and trends in bold. Show rather than tell where possible. Anchor numbers and statistics in context in parentheses for meaning.

Stick to verifiable facts; exclude opinion, speculation or emotion. 

Use emojis purposefully for tone or clarity.

Explain non-obvious acronyms, jargon and technical terms in parentheses.

Follow correct GitHub Markdown styling. E.g. Spaces after headings.
```
