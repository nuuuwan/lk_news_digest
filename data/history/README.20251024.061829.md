## Sri Lanka doubles down on green infrastructure and regional positioning even as governance creaks under reform load.  
Colombo opened the LEED Gold–designed SACEP headquarters, built with World Bank support under the PLEASE (Plastic Free Rivers and Seas for South Asia) program, anchoring a bid to be South Asia’s environmental hub. Port City Colombo was named fDi Intelligence’s “Best Knowledge Zone – Asia Pacific,” citing its SEZ (Special Economic Zone) framework and dispute-resolution architecture. Grid reliability got a lift with Siemens and DIMO completing the country’s largest substation at Habarana, while Panasian Power tied in another **5 MW** solar plant in Ampara. Yet electricity unbundling is mired in dispute: CEB engineers warned Parliament that the Preliminary Transfer Plan breaches the Sri Lanka Electricity Acts **(No. 36 of 2024; No. 14 of 2025)** and bypasses stakeholder consultation. ♻️⚡

## A digital pivot gathers pace as state and private actors seed capacity and jobs.  
The state convened AI workshops for public officers in the South and staged a national AI expo with **12,000+** visitors, while Virtusa and UK insurer CFC launched a **200-seat** Colombo digital services hub. Startups secured a combined **$160,000** at the “First Capital Startup Nation by Hatch” demo day, and Deutsche Bank marked **45 years** in Sri Lanka with fresh custody accolades. Meanwhile, the Government re-gazetted institutional portfolios—moving the Civil Security Department to Public Security and clustering digital bodies (including the Online Safety Commission) under the Digital Economy Ministry—aimed at execution clarity.

## Education reforms meet capacity deficits, prompting a reset toward execution and equity.  
The President asked FUTA (Federation of University Teachers’ Associations) for a plan to cut degree delays and strengthen research, as Parliament heard that teacher vacancies exceed **36,000** (with the Eastern and Central Provinces the most affected). Cabinet approved **Rs. 761.29 million** to print **6.04 million** textbooks for 2026 and **Rs. 630.2 million** to locally manufacture assistive devices under the 2025–27 budget framework. A Delhi research lab was named after PM Harini Amarasuriya during her official visit, underscoring an India-facing academic bridge, while the Government faces blowback—and legal support—from the HRCSL over a proposed ban on corporal punishment (the Commission calls it international best practice).

## Fiscal debates converge on credibility: consolidation must meet growth.  
A raft of budget commentaries urged broadening VAT, replacing para-tariffs, and shifting from transaction taxes toward growth-friendly progressivity, warning against high cigarette smuggling (state loses **~Rs. 80 billion** annually) and ad hoc incentives. Analysts flagged debt-service pressure above **40% of revenue** by 2028 and stressed capital-spend quality over quantity, with the IMF program requiring a **2.3%** primary surplus. The Cabinet signaled more funding in 2026 to mitigate floods, while Parliament’s oversight committee began tracking ministry-level 2025 budget execution—an accountability move that still needs transparent quarterly KPIs.

## Rule of law versus rule by law is in focus as the state pursues order without chilling initiative.  
Legal scholars cautioned that over-reliance on “rule by law” (control via punitive compliance) risks a risk-averse bureaucracy; they urged measurable accountability (not simply reduced discretion) to protect service delivery. Meanwhile, a public tussle over a police–lawyer confrontation prompted calls for restraint from a former SSP, and editorial scrutiny slammed “suspect pageantry” during high-profile deportations. The murder of Weligama’s PS Chairman underscored persistent gun violence, even as CID probes celebrity ties to alleged underworld figures dominated headlines.

## Reconciliation inches forward with land releases and historic reparations claims, but Geneva remains a test of delivery.  
The Government released **~706 acres** in the North and East to the public so far this year, and survivors filed a **$15 million** reparations claim for the **1989 Valvettithurai** massacre by the IPKF (Indian Peace Keeping Force) at the Office for Reparations—a first-of-its-kind mass atrocity claim. The Government avoided a vote on the latest UNHRC resolution, but Foreign Ministry briefings show it rejecting the text while promising domestic action; policy analysts say credible progress—on land, graves, prosecutions, and provincial polls—is vital to unwind external scrutiny.

## The green turn is real, but project governance must respect ecosystems and law.  
Mannar’s wind rollout faces allegations of Ramsar and wildlife law breaches by activists, who cite bird and turtle impacts and flooding from blocked canals; they urge a moratorium pending proper EIAs and community consent. In the hills, repeated human-caused fires ravaged the **38.6 km²** Hanthana EPA (Environmental Protection Area), exposing weak enforcement and the difficulty of prosecuting arson under the Forest Act. Conservationists, meanwhile, celebrated the Tea Board’s GI (Geographical Indication) project—Ceylon Tea’s EU registration would protect origin and value—while Dutch Trails and Aitken Spence were honored for sustainability programs. 🌿

## Social fabric strains are visible—from microfinance debt to cyber harms—requiring targeted, data-led response.  
A feminist coalition warned the new Microfinance Bill could “tighten the noose” on women debtors unless predatory lending and interest caps are addressed, and called for a national debt database. The 2025 Sri Lanka Barometer found rising civic engagement but uneven perceptions of reconciliation; an online tool now opens all four survey waves to the public. On digital harms, cyberbullying cases are up, spurring calls to pair legal enforcement with school-based digital literacy and platform accountability; media ethics were also scrutinized for sensationalism around suspects. 🧩

## Tourism, trade and aviation push outward—while South Asia’s trade shock demands pragmatism.  
Sri Lanka courted Italians at TTG Rimini (Italian arrivals up **33%** y/y in Jan–Sep), Emirates launched a technician-recruitment roadshow in Colombo, and the SL–Greater Mekong council sought tighter links with ASEAN supply chains. A regional economist roundtable urged South Asia to “pivot to Asia” and decouple trade from geopolitics, as US tariff volatility pushed the World Uncertainty Index up fivefold (Aug 2024–Aug 2025); they called for domestic reforms, regional trade pragmatism, and WTO strengthening.

## Markets prize strong governance signals: engineering ratings, board changes and capital market depth.  
Fitch assigned Hayleys Fentons an inaugural **A+(lka)**, while appointments at the CSE, Lanka Ventures/LVL Energy, Lanka Realty, and others point to governance renewal. The CSE saw robust turnover (**Rs. 9–12 billion** range on strong days) and crossings in banking, energy, and consumer counters, though profit-taking tempered rallies. Waste-to-energy facilities co-processed **~9,000 kg** of illicit cigarettes (two consignments worth **~Rs. 1.1 billion**), feeding clean power to the grid—a small but symbolic blending of rule-of-law and circular economy. ⚖️🔄

## The state’s agenda is crowded; sequencing and trust will decide outcomes.  
From education bottlenecks to energy market restructuring, from flood-proofing cities to securing GI labels for export brands, the Government is advancing on many fronts. The risk is overreach without consultation: PC (Provincial Council) polls remain in limbo, key reforms lack public debate, and legal moves (e.g., child-protection amendments) have run into stakeholder resistance. The week’s throughline is clear: **execution, consultation, and evidence**—not mandates alone—will determine whether targets become results.

## Model Prompt (for [gpt-5](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-5))

```
You will be given several Sri Lankan news articles from the past few days. Write a concise, cohesive editorial digest in the style of The Economist.

Go beyond summary — analyze and interpret the week’s developments into a unified narrative.

Use markdown level 2 headings (##) as crisp, but completely informative subheadings (which should be a complete sentence), each followed by a short, descriptive paragraph (not bullets) that adds context and nuance. Don't include a summary subheading. Each heading should be independent.

Highlight key facts and trends in bold. Show rather than tell where possible. Anchor numbers and statistics in context in parentheses for meaning.

Stick to verifiable facts; exclude opinion, speculation or emotion. 

Use emojis purposefully for tone or clarity.

Explain non-obvious acronyms, jargon and technical terms in parentheses.

Follow correct GitHub Markdown styling. E.g. Spaces after headings.
