## Sri Lanka banks a fragile recovery on IMF discipline while squeezing sin taxes to plug fiscal gaps.  
IMF staff and Colombo struck a staff-level deal on the fifth EFF review, unlocking about **$347m** (total disbursed: **$2.04bn**) if Parliament passes a 2026 Budget “in line with program parameters” and creditors advance restructurings. The Fund lauded **4.8% y/y growth in H1 2025**, inflation back to low single digits (**1.5% y/y** in September), and reserves at **$6.1bn**, but warned on “heightened downside risks.” The government, for its part, nudged up revenues at the margin by raising the betting levy to **18%** and doubling the casino entry fee for Sri Lankans to **$100**—a politically low‑friction tax, but no substitute for deeper base‑broadening. A cluster of state firms under the Industries Ministry handed the Treasury **Rs. 757.4m** in dividends, symbolic more than systemic. 🧮

## Power-sector reform has become a stress test of the administration’s credibility—and of union muscle.  
The CEB Engineers’ Union asked Parliament’s oversight committee to halt what it calls legally non‑compliant restructuring under the **2024 Electricity Act** (amended 2025): premature employee assignations, thin transfer plans, and politicised governance of successor companies. Unions widened a month‑long work‑to‑rule after talks collapsed. The Power Minister insists unbundling is “crucial,” even as a detailed industry critique argues the 2025 amendments retreat to state‑centric control, complicate investment, and risk starving the grid of the **~$5bn** capital it needs through 2044. The episode shows the old reform paradox: legislation without technocratic sequencing and buy‑in rarely delivers efficiency gains—and often raises borrowing costs.

## Anti-corruption got a digital spine, but politics still crowds the room.  
CIABOC launched a **Case-File Tracking System** with UNDP/Japan backing (**$202,000** in hardware) to streamline case flow, data integrity, and real-time monitoring—an IMF governance ask in code. Yet the Commission’s Director General appointment is mired in litigation and partisan crossfire; the government says critics should go to court, not the airwaves. Meanwhile the Justice Minister refused to disclose Easter bomb probe details mid‑investigation, as police chase those amplifying disinformation. Reform signal: digitise processes, ring‑fence independence, measure outcomes (convictions, asset recovery). Reform noise: personalised broadsides that corrode trust.

## Education reform aims to professionalise teachers, but delivery will hinge on institutions not speeches.  
The Prime Minister and Education Minister pledged to upgrade all teacher training colleges to degree‑awarding level (only Kuliyapitiya does so today) and roll out a new curriculum this year. That is a sensible human‑capital pivot if paired with school‑level support and performance metrics. Less clear is the state’s operational capacity: the Health Minister complains colonial‑era rules slow drug procurement (amid needle shortages) and public services creak under analog workflows—precisely where digital public infrastructure could deliver quick wins.

## Capital markets are exuberant—just as AI-driven market risk gets uncomfortably real.  
The IMF signal and bank block trades lifted the CSE (turnovers **Rs. 7–8.5bn** on peak days), but a pointed warning from a local academic highlights a global hazard: AI misinformation can whipsaw prices (remember the US “Pentagon blast” deepfake that erased **$500bn** in minutes). Sri Lanka’s shallow liquidity magnifies that risk. The prescription is unglamorous but urgent: surveillance tooling at the SEC, circuit-breaker hygiene at the CSE, and broker transparency about AI use—before a flash crash writes the rulebook.

## Trade policy is inching from compliance to competitiveness; exporters need the state to keep pace.  
With the EU Deforestation Regulation looming, analysts warn non‑compliance could shrink GDP (**–0.07%**) and cut rubber‑sector labour demand (**–15.6%**). The new risk‑based VAT refund regime replacing SVAT should ease cashflow—for low/medium‑risk taxpayers—if RAMIS actually works. The strategic play is larger: simplify tariffs, digitise border processes, and seal targeted FTAs; then help SMEs document supply chains. As one economist put it, “trade is survival” after 2022. Sri Lanka’s exports are still **~20% of GDP** (down from ~30% two decades ago); high‑tech goods are **1.5%** of manufactured exports (Vietnam: **46%**). The competitiveness gap is policy‑made.

## External headwinds and sanctions underscore how little slack the balance of payments has.  
Washington sanctioned a web of firms and vessels facilitating Iranian oil/LPG, flagging consignments that reached Sri Lanka via UAE intermediaries; any secondary‑sanctions spillover would pinch energy procurement. Domestically, gold hit a record **Rs. 300,000** per 22‑carat sovereign as global bullion topped **$4,000/oz**—a vote of no‑confidence in fiat elsewhere, and a reminder of how quickly capital seeks shelter.

## Politics remains transactional, but institutions are doing quiet, necessary work.  
The SJB and UNP plan a joint platform under SJB leadership—more arithmetic than alchemy. The Election Commission bagged “Electoral Commission of the Year” at a global awards event and hosted a UN technical mission on electoral reform (women’s participation, digitisation)—a small boost to confidence after years of deferrals. The Army marked its **76th** anniversary with **7,979** NCO promotions; the CID says it is juggling **20,000+** investigations—sober numbers in a system still rebuilding rule‑of‑law routines.

## Tea and tech show how niche excellence can punch above weight—if policy clears the runway.  
Ceylon specialty teas fetched charity‑auction records in Osaka (Telbedde’s OP1 at **¥65,000/kg**, New Vithanakande at **¥125,000/kg**), burnishing brand equity just as Horton Plains’ 12‑year “Nilu” bloom drew eco‑tourism buzz. In Colombo Port City’s IT Park, Xeptagon opened the first climate‑finance tech office, exporting Article 6 registries and blockchain audit trails to governments from Namibia to Vietnam. These are small, scalable moats—if energy is reliable, visas are frictionless, and taxes don’t blindside reinvestment.

## The week’s throughline: governance, not slogans, will decide whether green shoots become roots.  
Raising levies on casinos and ribbon‑cutting **Rs. 3bn** airport works are easy optics; restructuring a monopolistic utility without spooking investors, paying teachers for performance not seniority, refunding VAT in **≤45 days**, and securing a rules‑based path through debt‑service cliffs will do the heavy lifting. The IMF’s checklist—cost‑reflective tariffs, SOE governance, anti‑corruption with teeth—is not ideology. It is Sri Lanka’s best chance to replace stop‑gap cash with durable confidence.

## Model Prompt (for gpt-5)

```
You will be given several Sri Lankan news articles from the past few days. Write a concise, cohesive editorial digest in the style of The Economist.

Go beyond summary — analyze and interpret the week’s developments into a unified narrative.

Use markdown level 2 headings (##) as crisp, but completely informative subheadings (which should be a complete sentence), each followed by a short, descriptive paragraph (not bullets) that adds context and nuance. Don't include a summary subheading. Each heading should be independent.

Highlight key facts and trends in bold. Show rather than tell where possible. Anchor numbers and statistics in context in parentheses for meaning.

Stick to verifiable facts; exclude opinion, speculation or emotion. 

Use emojis purposefully for tone or clarity.

Explain non-obvious acronyms, jargon and technical terms in parentheses.

Follow correct GitHub Markdown styling. E.g. Spaces after headings.
```
