# 🇱🇰 Sri Lanka This Week

**2025-10-17 Edition.**

Generated at **2025-10-17 14:26:48** by **gpt-5** from **178** English News Articles published between **2025-10-10** and **2025-10-17**.

## Sri Lanka tightens the rules on who really owns companies even as institutions wobble ⚖️  

Colombo pushed long-delayed transparency reforms over the line, with Parliament’s Companies (Amendment) Act No. 12 of 2025 mandating disclosure of “beneficial owners” (the natural persons behind corporate veils) and banning bearer shares. Regulators say firms must keep detailed registers for 10 years and file new BO forms online, while Sri Lanka’s Financial Intelligence Unit inked MoUs with Vatican City and Mauritius to bolster cross‑border AML/CFT cooperation. Yet the governance dividend is blunted by frayed machinery: the national cloud (LGC) outage stalled core government portals; the Bar Association decried a police assault on a lawyer inside Mount Lavinia Courts; and the Opposition alleges the IGP usurped National Police Commission powers in officer transfers. A COPE grilling of the construction regulator (CIDA) over **Rs. 15 m** in legal fees added to a week of disquiet about checks and balances.  

## Debt minimalism gives way to pragmatism: tax, wages and a stopgap bond 💵  

A year after Sri Lanka swore off another IMF rescue, the arithmetic bites. Cabinet approved issuing dollar bonds as a short‑term liquidity tool, while Human Rights Watch argued decades of “ruinous” tax policy (with giveaways worth the equivalent of **56%** of revenues in 2022) starved education (down to **1.5% of GDP** in 2022). Policy wonks pressed for “tax morale” (trust and compliance) and spending efficiency over blunt austerity; a former Indian planner warned a no‑IMF path would have been “twice as painful.” Meanwhile, the Government raised the private‑sector minimum wage to **Rs. 27,000** a month from April (**Rs. 30,000** from Jan 2026), and courted American investors as BOI hosted a 23‑member US think‑tank delegation. The message: reform first, but don’t spook growth.  

## Trade logistics rebound as ports run hot; compliance headwinds build 📦  

The port of Colombo posted post‑tax profits of **Rs. 32.2 b** in Jan–Aug (up **71%** y/y), and targets a record **8.2 m TEUs** in 2025 as the India‑backed West Container Terminal ramps up (capacity seen doubling to **15 m TEUs** by 2026). Customs logged its highest single‑day revenue—**Rs. 24.9 b**—buoyed by resumed vehicle imports; a Court of Appeal path was set to release LC‑snagged cars against bonds. A court also upheld open access for adventure operators at Samanalawewa, curbing rent‑seeking in public waters. The tail risk: market access rules tightening abroad. Exporters were warned to ready for the EU’s deforestation regulation (EUDR) by **Dec 2025**—notably for rubber and related products—linking traceability to trade.  

## Energy transition inches ahead, but the balance sheet still matters ⚡  

WindForce agreed a **10 MW** wind project (Rs. **4.2 b**, 75:25 debt–equity) in Puttalam; apparel majors deepened climate pledges (Brandix Net Zero facilities; MAS **24%** cut in Scope 1–2 since 2019; Teejay at **14%** renewables); CEAT Kelani secured ISO 14064‑1 for GHG reporting; and Lanka Ashok Leyland posted **Rs. 7.75 b** H1 revenue with a plan to relaunch ultra‑low‑floor AC buses for city routes. A new evening feed‑in tariff (**Rs. 45.80/kWh**, 6–10 pm) aims to entice home solar‑plus‑storage, but analysts note double‑digit loan rates can stretch payback beyond a decade—proof that decarbonisation in Sri Lanka will be financed, or it won’t happen.  

## Health care oscillates between procurement drives and shortages 🩺  

The Health Ministry approved roughly **Rs. 2.5 b** in drug buys (kidney‑care EPO, critical antibiotics and biologics) and trumpeted domestic sterile infusion plans at a BOI plant. Doctors’ unions, meanwhile, flagged acute shortfalls in ICU staples (from noradrenaline to protamine) and sutures even as other SKUs pile up—evidence of choppy logistics. Mental health moved into the digital mainstream, with eChannelling’s “eMindCare” platform and rising calls to destigmatise care; public‑health voices linked neurodegenerative disease trends to air toxics and solvents, underscoring the cost of environmental neglect.  

## Devolution drifts while Geneva divides  

A year into office, the Government has yet to fix the legal path to Provincial Council polls; ministers now float an election “next year” under either the old system or revised law. Critics say the delay blunts devolution, just as UNHRC scrutiny continues—Colombo opted against forcing a vote on the latest Geneva resolution, a tactical defuse the Opposition brands capitulation. At home, an op‑ed backed an “inclusive approach” (from ethnic reconciliation to child protection and LGBTQ+ decriminalisation), arguing domestic delivery is now the best shield against external probes.  

## AI permeates commerce—and exposes brittle pipes 🧠  

From Baby Cheramy’s 🇱🇰 tri‑lingual generative AI diaper helpdesk to hyper‑personalised commerce experiments, AI is going mainstream. Globally, Salesforce and OpenAI unveiled a deep integration to bring frontier models into enterprise workflows. Sri Lanka’s cautionary note: a prolonged Lanka Government Cloud outage knocked critical registries offline, reminding policymakers that trustworthy, explainable AI (XAI) and digitisation pay off only when the plumbing stays up.  

## Blue carbon versus concrete: Mandaitivu tests climate credibility 🌿  

Plans for a Sri Lanka Cricket‑backed stadium complex on Mandaitivu Island drew sharp pushback from conservationists, who note the site’s mangroves, seagrass and salt marshes—a “blue carbon” triad—buffer Jaffna from floods and nourish fisheries. The island sits in a high‑wind, flood‑prone zone; the UDA’s own plan flags it as “high‑sensitive.” Given Colombo’s global advocacy on mangroves and seagrass, bulldozers here would be a credibility own‑goal. A softer week’s note: proposals to turn roadside reserves into “bio‑corridors” along the Kadawatha–Mirigama expressway show that greening transport can be cheap (≈**0.01%** of capex) and popular. 🚴‍♀️  

## The growth story is real—but fragile  

The private sector is hiring (Virtusa: **200+** roles), investing (a flurry of IPO prep, rare‑earths debates), and exporting (Thimark’s 🇰🇪 hydropower contract; apparel’s circularity drive). Ports are humming; Customs coffers swelled. Yet the week’s lesson is structural: transparency laws, tax credibility and spending efficiency are prerequisites for durable recovery; devolution, judicial independence and police professionalism are its political scaffolding. Without those, even the best profit chart can be one outage—or one resolution—away from unravelling.

## Model Prompt (for gpt-5)

```
You will be given several Sri Lankan news articles from the past few days. Write a concise, cohesive editorial digest in the style of The Economist.

Go beyond summary — analyze and interpret the week’s developments into a unified narrative.

Use markdown level 2 headings (##) as crisp, but completely informative subheadings (which should be a complete sentence), each followed by a short, descriptive paragraph (not bullets) that adds context and nuance. Don't include a summary subheading. Each heading should be independent.

Highlight key facts and trends in bold. Show rather than tell where possible. Anchor numbers and statistics in context in parentheses for meaning.

Stick to verifiable facts; exclude opinion, speculation or emotion. 

Use emojis purposefully for tone or clarity.

Explain non-obvious acronyms, jargon and technical terms in parentheses.

Follow correct GitHub Markdown styling. E.g. Spaces after headings.
```
