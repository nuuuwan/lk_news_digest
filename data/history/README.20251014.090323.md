## Sri Lanka’s path out of crisis still runs through trade, not tariffs.  
An unusual coalition of economists, investors and exporters is converging on the same prescription: open up. At a public-sector reform forum, Rehana Thowfeek argued that protectionism and para‑tariffs have entrenched an anti‑export bias, shrinking exports from about 30% of GDP to **~20%** (since 2000), while high‑tech goods are only **1.5%** of manufactured exports (Vietnam: **46%**). Her remedy—tariff simplification, digitised trade facilitation, reskilling for AI, and a dedicated trade-negotiation office—echoed investors at the BOI’s meeting with US think tanks: macro stability is improving under the IMF, but market access and credible, rules‑based policy will determine whether capital follows.

## The IMF’s fifth review keeps the macro narrative intact, but the 2026 Budget will test political will.  
Sri Lanka reached a staff‑level agreement unlocking **~US$347m**—conditional on the 2026 Appropriation Bill aligning with programme parameters and debt restructuring completion. Growth surprised at **+4.8% y/y (H1 2025)**; reserves reached **US$6.1bn** (Aug). The Fund’s message is blunt: stay with cost‑recovery energy pricing; avoid expenditure arrears; keep tax reforms intact; and insulate the Central Bank. That means no backsliding on tariff holidays or populist budgets. The immediate caution: a tariff‑backed revenue model on imports (including vehicles) is cyclical, not structural.

## Structural reform is colliding with street politics in the power sector.  
The Government calls CEB unbundling “crucial” to achieve renewables; engineers call the process rushed and opaque, with legal sequencing and HR assignations outpacing governance set‑up. Trade unions have escalated work‑to‑rule, and mid‑level committees seem to pre‑empt successor boards. The deeper issue is trust: fiscal discipline and electricity-sector reform are pillars of the IMF programme, but public buy‑in is thin when reform looks like decree. Policy certainty on market design (dispatch rules, debt clean‑up, SOE governance, and a ring‑fenced pension vehicle) remains the missing piece.

## Export competitiveness will be shaped as much by Brussels as by Colombo.  
The EU’s Deforestation‑free Products Regulation (EUDR), delayed to December 2025 (SMEs: June 2026), will force supply‑chain due diligence for rubber and rubber‑based products—a core Sri Lankan export. Companies must file geolocation data and beneficial ownership‑clean DDS; fines can reach **4%** of EU‑wide turnover. For SMEs, that is intimidating—but it can be a USP. Apparel leaders already report momentum: Brandix cut emissions **84%**, MAS diverted **99%** of waste from landfill, and Hirdaramani netted SBTi approval; compliance has become a sales pitch. The risk is stratification: firms that digitise and comply will thrive; the rest will be squeezed. 🇪🇺

## Institutions matter: signals on policing, elections and the rule of law are mixed.  
Sri Lanka’s Election Commission was named “Electoral Commission of the Year” abroad, even as postponed provincial polls linger at home. The UN’s electoral mission stands ready to support reforms. The Bar Association condemned a police assault on a lawyer inside court; Jaffna lawyers struck over an allegedly warrant‑less search. And the Government’s quarrel with security entitlements of ex‑Presidents, now a political football, sends the wrong incentive to future leaders who govern in risky times. Investors read these cues: macro numbers attract, but institutions keep capital anchored.

## The foreign‑policy pivot is cautious, open for business and increasingly pragmatic.  
With the IMF programme steady, Colombo is leveraging convening power: it chairs WHO’s SE Asia Regional Committee, woos American think tanks, hosts the AIA International architecture forum and GABV’s Asia‑Pacific meet on value‑based banking. The BOI pitched specialised zones and logistics; Colombo Port (post‑tax profit **Rs. 32.2bn** in Jan–Aug; **+71% y/y**) signals throughput strength after the Eastern Terminal and JCT expansion. The Kankesanthurai (KKS) port debate highlights a strategic opportunity: low‑cost, short‑sea links to southern India could integrate the North into regional value chains, lowering logistics costs **20–40%** for perishables. It is a choice between potential and paralysis.

## Private capital is sniffing around again—but wants fewer frictions and better tax predictability.  
Market turnover is humming (several Rs. **8bn** days), with bank crosses and rights issues; LB Finance seeks **Rs. 20bn** in debentures; IPOs (e.g., packaging) are back on roadshows. Yet CEOs still cite six drags: tariff opacity, non‑tariff barriers, customs delays, unpredictable taxes, rigid labour rules, and politicised bureaucracy. The Accra-to-Shenzhen lesson applies: FDI is not charity; it is a vote on the credibility of rules. Reform first; growth follows.

## Sri Lanka’s strengths—brand, craft and culture—are quietly compounding into hard currency.  
Ceylon Tea fetched Guinness‑record prices in Osaka with proceeds to estate communities; Michelin Keys recognised Tea Trails (three Keys), Wild Coast (two), Cape Weligama (one); apparel and tech firms won at SLIM Digis and global design awards. The domestic eco‑tourism court ruling on fair access at Samanalawewa affirmed public-resource equity, critical for a higher‑spend visitor mix. In the East, hospitality assets like Sun Siyam Pasikudah position for design‑led recovery; in Negombo, retirement living and wellness tourism are rising niches. This is where intangibles—trust, design, sustainability—become tradables.

## The near-term to-do list is short, specific and measurable.  
- Pass a 2026 Budget that preserves the primary surplus path, resists ad hoc tax waivers, and funds social protection adequately (targeting and coverage).  
- Sequence CEB restructuring with transparent market rules, an independent system operator, and a statutory pensions/benefits vehicle before workforce moves.  
- Launch a one‑stop EUDR compliance desk for SMEs (geo‑mapping, DDS templates, lab access) to convert compliance into contracts.  
- Codify post‑enactment judicial review and Electoral Commission independence; publish a time‑bound provincial‑polls roadmap.  
- Accelerate beneficial‑ownership registries (B01–B07) and tame customs through end‑to‑end digitisation; speed litigation on economic crimes to show consequences, not just arrests.  

Sri Lanka is edging out of triage. The macro anchors are holding; the capital markets are breathing; and global buyers still want what the island is uniquely good at—quality, authenticity and sustainability. The choice now is between an open, rules‑based economy where firms scale beyond the island—or a comfortable cul‑de‑sac of para‑tariffs and procedural purgatory. The world won’t decide for Colombo. It rarely does.

## Model Prompt (for gpt-5)

```
You will be given several Sri Lankan news articles from the past few days. Write a concise, cohesive editorial digest in the style of The Economist.

Go beyond summary — analyze and interpret the week’s developments into a unified narrative.

Use markdown level 2 headings (##) as crisp, but completely informative subheadings (which should be a complete sentence), each followed by a short, descriptive paragraph (not bullets) that adds context and nuance. Don't include a summary subheading. Each heading should be independent.

Highlight key facts and trends in bold. Show rather than tell where possible. Anchor numbers and statistics in context in parentheses for meaning.

Stick to verifiable facts; exclude opinion, speculation or emotion. 

Use emojis purposefully for tone or clarity.

Explain non-obvious acronyms, jargon and technical terms in parentheses.

Follow correct GitHub Markdown styling. E.g. Spaces after headings.
```
