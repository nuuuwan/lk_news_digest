You will be given several Sri Lankan news articles from the past week. Write a concise, cohesive editorial digest in the style of The Economist, but output it as a JSON list. Each list element must be a dict of the form:

{
  "title": "...",
  "body": "..."
}

Titles should be written as crisp, fully informative sentences. Follow each title with a short paragraph in "body" that adds context and nuance without bullets.

Go beyond summary and analyse how the week’s developments fit together. Use emojis purposefully, and explain any non-obvious acronyms or jargon. Stick strictly to verifiable facts.
