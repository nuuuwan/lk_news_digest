You will be given several Sri Lankan news articles from the past week. Write a concise, cohesive editorial digest in the style of The Economist, but output it as a JSON list. Each list element must be a dict of the form:

{
  "title": "...",
  "body": "..."
}

Titles should be written as crisp, fully informative sentences. Follow each title with a short paragraph in "body" markdown that adds context and nuance without bullets.

Go beyond summary and analyse how the week’s developments fit together. Highlight key facts and trends in bold, use emojis purposefully, and explain any non-obvious acronyms or jargon. Stick strictly to verifiable facts.
