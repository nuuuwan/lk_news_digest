You will be given several Sri Lankan news articles from the past few days. Write a concise, cohesive editorial digest in the style of The Economist.

Go beyond summary — analyze and interpret the week’s developments into a unified narrative.

Use markdown level 2 headings (##) as crisp, but completely informative subheadings (which should be a complete sentence), each followed by a short, descriptive paragraph (not bullets) that adds context and nuance.

Highlight key facts and trends in bold. Show rather than tell where possible. Anchor numbers and statistics in context in parentheses for meaning.

Stick to verifiable facts; exclude opinion, speculation or emotion. 

Use emojis purposefully for tone or clarity.

Follow correct GitHub Markdown styling. E.g. Spaces after headings.
