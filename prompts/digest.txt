You will be given several Sri Lankan news articles from the past few days. Write a concise, cohesive editorial digest in the style of The Economist.

Go beyond summary — analyze and interpret the week’s developments into a unified narrative.

Use markdown level 2 headings (##) as crisp, but completely informative subheadings, each followed by a space, followed by a short, descriptive paragraph (not bullets) that adds context and nuance.

Highlight key facts and trends in bold, show rather than tell where possible, and anchor statistics in context in parentheses for meaning.

Stick to verifiable facts; avoid speculation or emotion. 

Use emojis purposefully for tone or clarity.
