## Stabilisation gains, but reform stamina is the real test üìà  
Sri Lanka‚Äôs macro narrative improved notably this week. IMF staff reached a staff-level agreement on the fifth EFF review, unlocking about **$347 million** pending Board sign-off, with the Fund noting **inflation near target, reserves at $6.1 billion (end-Sep 2025)**, and **H1 2025 GDP up 4.8% y/y**. Markets responded: the CSE logged daily turnovers above **Rs. 7‚Äì8 billion**, while banks and diversified financials led block trades. Yet the Fund‚Äôs to-do list is clear: a 2026 Budget ‚Äúin line with program parameters,‚Äù cost-recovery energy pricing, SOE governance, arrears avoidance, debt-office operationalisation, and legal reforms (PPP, SOE, procurement, asset management) consistent with the new Public Financial Management Act. In short, stabilisation has bought time; credibility now hangs on execution.

## Growth versus debt servitude: calibrating macro-linked risk  
At CA Sri Lanka‚Äôs National Conference, the Institute‚Äôs president argued Sri Lanka should not throttle growth to minimise future payouts on macro‚Äëlinked bonds (MLBs). An IMF working paper estimates MLB-linked debt service could reach **$150‚Äì270 million a year in 2028‚Äì2038** (roughly **$2 billion** over the decade), tied to GDP outcomes. The profession‚Äôs deeper worry is state capacity: just **38 professionally qualified accountants among 1,600** public finance officers managing multi‚Äëbillion‚Äërupee budgets. The message: ethics and skills are not soft add‚Äëons; they are the ‚Äúinfrastructure‚Äù for investor confidence.

## Power reform: ideology, financing and a brewing confrontation ‚ö°  
Talks between Government and CEB unions collapsed; a month‚Äëlong work‚Äëto‚Äërule is set to intensify. Engineers urged parliamentary oversight, alleging assignations and asset transfers are proceeding without statutory footing under the **2024 Electricity Act** and its **2025 amendment**. The strategic rub: the 2025 law recentralises governance and narrows private entry‚Äîpopular with unions, problematic for capital formation. With the CEB eyeing multi‚Äëbillion‚Äëdollar investment needs through 2044 and sovereign guarantees constrained by the IMF program, Sri Lanka risks a pincer: higher system costs (security‚Äëconstrained dispatch) and thinner financing pipelines. The AIIB, for its part, reaffirmed support with a tilt to green energy and transport‚Äîuseful, but not a substitute for bankable sector architecture.

## Rule of law: sharper tools, contested referees  
Parliament saw challenges to the appointment of the CIABOC Director General, even as Government defended the process and the Commission rolled out a **digital case‚Äëtracking system** (UNDP/Japan‚Äësupported) to raise transparency and throughput. The Supreme Court, meanwhile, granted leave to proceed on FR petitions over the 2021 arrest of former CID officials, signalling judicial scrutiny of high‚Äëprofile cases. The broader pattern is mixed: better plumbing (systems) and higher expectations (IMF governance benchmarks), amid politicised appointments and long‚Äërunning trust deficits. Outcome metrics‚Äînot rhetoric‚Äîwill decide legitimacy.

## Social regulation: modernisation without scaffolding risks backlash  
Two policy fronts exposed capacity gaps. A push to ban corporal punishment and raise the age of protection drew criticism that schools lack counsellors and teachers lack training; absent investments, a rights‚Äëled law could read as an unfunded mandate. Online, police warned of surging scams via Telegram and WhatsApp, while legal analysts urged scrapping the Online Safety Act‚Äôs vague speech offences and replacing Commission‚Äëcentric takedowns with a **fast, cooperative channel** through SL‚ÄëCERT/TRC for platform action. In both cases, the principle is sound‚Äîprotect children and citizens‚Äîbut sustained funding and institutional design, not headline bans, will determine impact.

## Trade exposure: compliance is competitiveness, and sanctions bite üåç  
Export strategists made the hard sell: treat EU‚Äëdriven sustainability rules (e.g., EUDR, CSRD) as
