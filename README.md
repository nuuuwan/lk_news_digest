## Sri Lanka‚Äôs tentative recovery is gaining structure, but policy continuity will decide its durability. üìà 

The IMF staff reached a staff-level agreement on the Fifth Review of Sri Lanka‚Äôs Extended Fund Facility, unlocking about **$347 million** upon Board sign-off and keeping total disbursements on track at roughly **$2.04 billion** (approved March 2023). The macro dashboard has turned: headline inflation is back to low single digits (**1.5% y/y in September**), reserves have rebuilt to **$6.1 billion** (end‚ÄëSeptember), and real GDP rose **4.8% y/y** in 1H 2025. Markets responded on cue: the CSE advanced after the IMF news (ASPI +0.51% on 9 Oct; turnover buoyed by bank crossings), even as intermittent profit‚Äëtaking trimmed earlier **1,800‚Äëpoint** gains. The AIIB signalled it will lean into green power and transport, aligning with the Government‚Äôs **cost‚Äërecovery pricing** and SOE reform pledges under the program. Yet external jitter remains visible at the retail counter: gold hit a local record (22k sovereign above **Rs. 300,000**) as global bullion pierced **$4,000/oz**, a reminder of lingering global risk hedging.

## Power-sector reform is stalling just as capital needs are rising, raising financing and reliability risks. ‚ö° 

After Parliament‚Äôs 2025 electricity amendments re‚Äëcentralised decision rights and narrowed private participation relative to the **2024** unbundling law, CEB unions escalated a month‚Äëlong work‚Äëto‚Äërule and suspended cooperation with the reform secretariat. The Engineers‚Äô Union asked a parliamentary committee to intervene, alleging assignations and asset transfers are proceeding without statutory sequencing, that boards lack operational autonomy, and that the mandated pensions vehicle is still not established. The critique mirrors a broader analytical warning: shifting from least‚Äëcost dispatch to ‚Äúsecurity‚Äëconstrained‚Äù dispatch without competitive discipline could raise the cost base, while IMF constraints limit sovereign backstopping for capex. The risk is simple: a re‚Äëbundled status quo facing **multi‚Äëbillion‚Äëdollar** grid and generation needs, strained labor relations, and investors left waiting.

## Governance is digitising in places, but institutions remain under intense scrutiny. üõ°Ô∏è 

CIABOC launched a digital Case Tracking System (with UNDP/Japan support) to improve real‚Äëtime monitoring and record integrity, consistent with UNCAC commitments. Simultaneously, the Government defended the appointment of CIABOC‚Äôs Director General, inviting critics to test it in court, amid parliamentary questions about the Constitutional Council‚Äôs process. The Supreme Court, for its part, granted leave to proceed on three FR petitions concerning the 2021 arrests of ex‚ÄëCID officers including Shani Abeysekara (arguments set for **14 May 2026**). Meanwhile, critics of the Online Safety Act urged repeal of its most expansive offence (Section 12) and junking the Commission‚Äëcentric takedown model in favour of a **cooperative, rapid-removal** mechanism via SL‚ÄëCERT/TRC; early prosecutions have largely served political actors, not the female victims the law had highlighted. Net effect: incremental digitisation of caseflow, persistent contestation over appointments, and a still‚Äëunsettled balance between speech and safety.

## Trade openness is again on the table as regulation tightens abroad and sanctions reach home shores. üåè 

Exporters warned that compliance must become a competitive edge, not a cost centre: the EU‚Äôs Green shift and rules like **EUDR** will screen market access; Sri Lankan rubber‚Äôs non‚Äëcompliance could shave **0.07% of GDP** and cut sectoral labour demand by **15.6%**. A policy case mounted for ‚Äútrading our way to recovery‚Äù: exports as a share of GDP have slid from ~30% (early 2000s) to ~20% today; high‚Äëtech exports sit at **1.5%** of manufactured exports (Vietnam ~46%). Recommended fixes were familiar but time‚Äëbound‚Äîsimpler tariffs, digitised trade facilitation, a dedicated negotiations office, and skills to absorb AI‚Äëdriven value chains. External compliance snags are no longer theoretical: new US sanctions named a UAE‚Äëhubbed network moving Iranian LPG, citing consignments delivered by GAS DIOR and MAX STAR to end users in Sri Lanka (late‚Äë2024/early‚Äë2025). The sanctions raise due‚Äëdiligence requirements for traders and banks, even as the Treasury approved Murban crude supplies (four cargoes, Jan‚ÄìApr **2026**) via BB Energy Asia to stabilise refinery runs.

## Services and tech try to outrun the drag: climate finance, AI and architecture anchor Colombo‚Äôs soft power. üå± 

Port City‚Äôs IT Park saw its first operational tenant: Xeptagon, a climate‚Äëfinance technology firm rolling out Article 6‚Äëaligned carbon registries and exchanges across multiple continents, positioning Sri Lanka in a niche where trust and auditability matter. The AIA International Conference returned to Colombo, with Moshe Safdie arguing for nature-integrated urbanism; CA Sri Lanka‚Äôs National Conference convened over **2,600** delegates to link global insight to local reform; and Futurity partnered IESL to deploy an AI assistant at Techno 2025, a small but telling step in user‚Äëfacing digitalisation. The CSE will run a full‚Äëday live disaster‚Äërecovery trading exercise‚Äîan operational resilience tick in a market still modernising its plumbing.

## Social policy is reforming under constraint: targeted fixes in schools and hospitals, and fiscal nips elsewhere. 

The Government aims to lift all teacher‚Äëtraining colleges to degree‚Äëawarding status (only Kuliyapitiya does so today), aligning with a new curriculum roll‚Äëout in **2025**; the Foreign Minister flagged a Truth and Reconciliation Commission bill ‚Äúsoon‚Äù and **Provincial Council** elections in **2026** (electoral system TBD), alongside a PTA replacement bill. Health authorities moved to plug a **dialysis needle** shortfall after an initial supplier missed the spec, with emergency buys and a shipment due **by 12 October**; the Health Minister said several colonial‚Äëera procurement rules still slow decision‚Äëmaking. The Treasury raised gambling levies to **18%** of gross collections and doubled the domestic casino entry fee to **$100**, while SOEs under the Industries Ministry remitted **Rs. 757.4 million** in dividends on better operating results. Public security headlines cut both ways: police warned of WhatsApp/Telegram job‚Äëscam phishing, and a Kadawatha raid seized **>18 kg** of heroin, cannabis, hashish and meth.

## Diplomacy is active, but multilateral headwinds persist. 

Sri Lanka renewed ties with South Africa (with TRC know‚Äëhow explicitly in view), while Geneva adopted the latest HRC resolution on Sri Lanka ‚Äúwithout a vote‚Äù after Colombo declined to force a division despite rejecting OSLAP‚Äôs mandate extension‚Äîleaving external evidence‚Äëgathering in place. At home, Parliament heard that Easter bombing investigations cannot be disclosed mid‚Äëprobe; abroad, **UNICEF South Asia** ranked Sri Lanka third in the region by share of children displaced by disasters (**~4.6%** of under‚Äë18s; ~**280,000** over 2016‚Äì2022), underscoring why climate resilience and disaster‚Äërisk finance are now macro priorities as much as moral ones. üåßÔ∏è

## The bottom line: stabilization is real; investability still hinges on execution. 

Sri Lanka has chalked up **strong program performance** (IMF), rebuilt buffers, and sent early reform signals (cost‚Äëreflective tariffs, SOE bills, procurement law in train). But power‚Äësector drift, fitful rule‚Äëof‚Äëlaw optics, and external compliance shocks can quickly tax a thin credibility margin. Growth that lifts exports and formal jobs‚Äînot gold prices‚Äîwill ultimately determine whether the next **$2 billion** in debt service savings comes from better terms or bigger denominators.

## Model Prompt

```
You will be given several Sri Lankan news articles from the past few days. Write a concise, cohesive editorial digest in the style of The Economist.

Go beyond summary ‚Äî analyze and interpret the week‚Äôs developments into a unified narrative.

Use markdown level 2 headings (##) as crisp, but completely informative subheadings (which should be a complete sentence), each followed by a short, descriptive paragraph (not bullets) that adds context and nuance.

Highlight key facts and trends in bold. Show rather than tell where possible. Anchor numbers and statistics in context in parentheses for meaning.

Stick to verifiable facts; exclude opinion, speculation or emotion. 

Use emojis purposefully for tone or clarity.

Follow correct GitHub Markdown styling. E.g. Spaces after headings.
```
